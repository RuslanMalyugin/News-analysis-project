News Agency reported.The Islamic Republic submitted a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency as its official notice that it may produce 20% enriched uranium after the country passed a law calling for the measure, ISNA cited Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, as saying.Salehi?s comments come at a sensitive time as Iranians mark the one-year anniversary of the U.S. assassination of General Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3. The killing pushed the long-term foes to the brink of war, capping a security crisis in the Persian Gulf that started when President Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal.Iran Approves Bill to End Nuclear Inspections in Blow to BidenThat agreement placed strict limits of 3.67% on the purity level of enriched uranium Iran is permitted to produce. The country breached the cap in response to Trump?s withdrawal and after the European Union was unable to offer relief from U.S. sanctions.Iran last month passed a law triggering the hike in enrichment levels and halting voluntary UN nuclear inspections, if the U.S. doesn?t provide sanctions relief within months of its implementation. The legislation says the ramp-up in atomic activity is for peaceful purposes.New LawWhile the law has been approved by Iran?s top political chamber, Salehi said President Hassan Rouhani still needs to issue a directive and an ?action order? for its official implementation to begin.?We are soldiers and our hands are on the trigger. Once the chief gives the order, we can act very quickly,? Salehi said. Even if Iran does act, it still would be some distance from accumulating all the components required for a weapon -- something it?s repeatedly said it?s not seeking.Iran has said it wants to develop a civilian atomic program and upgrade aging power stations, though the U.S. accuses it of trying to build a nuclear bomb. The 2015 nuclear deal was designed to satisfy concerns among Western powers, including the U.S. and EU, in exchange for sanctions relief.About 630 kilograms (1,389 pounds) of low-enriched uranium must be purified to 90% to yield the 15-22 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium needed by an expert bomb-maker to craft a weapon.(Adds background on nuclear activities in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said this would only happen on extremely rare occasions, and that the government was not recommending the mixing of vaccines, which require at least two doses given several weeks apart.

It advanced almost 50% in December, when it breached $20,000 for the first time.The latest gains top an eye-popping rally for the controversial digital asset in 2020, which rebounded sharply after a severe crash in March that saw it lose 25% amid the coronavirus pandemic.Bitcoin has increasingly been ?embraced in more global investment portfolios as holders expand beyond tech geeks and speculators,? Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone wrote in a note last month. Proponents have seized on the narrative that the coin could act as a store of wealth amid supposed rampant central-bank money printing, even as inflation remains mostly muted.Bitcoin should eventually climb to about about $400,000, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Investments, told Bloomberg Television in a Dec. 16 interview.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Shopify Stock Forecast Shopify offers an e-commerce platform primarily to small and midsize businesses. The e-commerce company has two leading segments that drive revenue: subscriptions and merchant solutions.The subscription solutions segment allows Shopify merchants to conduct e-commerce on a variety of platforms, including the company's website, physical stores, pop-up stores, kiosks and social networks.Merchant solutions are defined as add-on products for the platform that facilitate e-commerce and include Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital.The company's main e-commerce stock competitors include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (NYSE: BABA) and Etsy Inc (NASDAQ: ETSY).Of the Benzinga traders and investors surveyed, 67% told us Shopify would reach $2,000 per share by the end of next year.Respondents said Shopify will continue to see strength in 2021 off continued nationwide adoption of online shopping, away from traditional brick and mortar retailers.Traders also said that even with nationwide distribution of a coronavirus vaccine already underway, the popularity of e-commerce will continue to grow. They believe American consumers like being able to shop a variety of merchants simultaneously and have their purchases delivered to their front door.Many traders and investors also said they are keen on Shopify's UI/UX, noting how the platform has a high ease-of-access for small and midsize retailers looking to take their business online.It should be noted the latest price target for Shopify was reported by Susquehanna on Dec. 2. The analyst firm set a target for $950, expecting shares of the e-commerce company to fall within 12 months. Going into the end of 2020, Shopify shares were trading lower following the stock's recent surge, which was driven by e-commerce trends and holiday sales optimism. COVID-19 vaccine news has also driven a rotation from e-commerce names into reopening sectors such as traditional retail and travel.Current and prospective investors should take note Shopify's fourth-quarter earnings date is estimated for Feb. 17.See Also: How To Buy Shopify Stock.This survey was conducted by Benzinga in December 2020 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents.

He said 18.6% of all commercial transactions are in dollars, while 77.3% are carried out in bolivars with debit cards. Only 3.4% are paid with bolivar notes.?They have a war against our physical currency. We are moving this year to a more profound digital economy, in expansion. I?ve set the goal of an economy that?s 100% digital,? Maduro said, adding that physical money will eventually disappear.Venezuela?s currency has lost 99% of its value during three years of hyperinflation, forcing the country to issue higher-denomination notes that in turn become useless in record time. The largest note now in circulation, 50,000 bolivars, is worth about $0.04. The government has delayed plans to issue a 100,000 bolivar bill, which currently would be worth less than $0.10.After formerly subsidized fuel prices were increased in June, cash is now only used to ride public transportation, and the Caracas subway routinely stops charging passengers due to cash shortages.Since late 2019, local banks have slowly started to offer accounts and financial products in U.S. dollars, but those remain limited as there?s no clearing system in place to allow for digital transactions in U.S. dollars.Some banks have had technical meetings with Venezuela?s central bank in an attempt to solve the problem amid high skepticism and caution due to U.S. sanctions. But Maduro vowed to create ?payment formats? allowing transactions using savings and checking accounts in U.S. dollars.A press official with the Central Bank of Venezuela didn?t immediately respond to a request for comment.Despite promising to expand the use of the U.S. dollar in the economy, Maduro said a formal dollarization wouldn?t happen. ?Venezuela has its currency and we are going to defend it,? he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

On Wednesday, co-hosts Chris Katje and Mitch Hoch shared their top SPACs that are trading between $10 and $11. Chris's Picks: RedBall Acquisition (NASDAQ: RBAC) has been linked to merging with Fenway Sports Group. A deal would give investors another publicly traded sports team. Fenway Sports Group owns MLB's Boston Red Sox and the Liverpool Football Club of the English Premier League.Both teams have strong brand awareness and could attract investments from fans. Another catalyst mentioned was the media rights. A new deal with Fox Corp (NASDAQ: FOX) kicks in for MLB in 2022, and the EPL is negotiating new deals as well. Fenway Sports Group also is a majority owner in a local sports media company that airs Red Sox games. Falcon Capital Acquisition (NASDAQ: FCAC) is targeting a company in media or consumer technology sectors. The team behind the SPAC includes Jeff Sagansky. The pick here is following Sagansky, who is part of the team that did deals for DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and Skillz Inc (NASDAQ: SKLZ). The team behind Hyliion Holdings (NASDAQ: HYLN) has a second SPAC that could be a good pick below $11. Tortoise Acquisition Corp II (NASDAQ: SNPR) is targeting the sustainability field. The history of the Hyliion deal could make this SPAC attractive to a target company. Hyliion shares traded over $50 and were one of the best performing SPACs earlier in 2020. Lefteris Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: LFTR) is targeting the fintech sector. With rumors of companies like Sofi, eToro and others going public, fintech could be a host sector to watch in 2021. The management team in the SPAC has history with ETrade, Coinbase and TD Ameritrade. Burgundy Technology (NASDAQ: BTAQ) is a company targeting technology or enterprise software. The management team include Leo Apotheker, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard (NASDAQ: HPE) and SAP SE (NASDAQ: SAP). Apotheker spent over 20 years at SAP and helped transform the company from a single product to a multi-solution business. Co-CEO Jim Mackey spent years at Citigroup, SAP, OpenText and Blackberry (NASDAQ: BB). While at Blackberry, Mackey helped the company shift from a mobile company to end-point management. Burgundy Technology mentions Israel as a target area in its filing. Apotheker graduated from the Hebrew University of Israel. Several large Israeli companies are targeting 2021 IPO or SPAC deals, which could make Burgundy a good pick here. The list of rumored names include REE Automotive, Taboola, Outbrain and eToro. Related Link: 12 New SPACS Filed Offerings On Friday: What Investors Should KnowMitch's Picks: Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: SEAH) is a name that has been mentioned on the show several times. The company is targeting the sports and entertainment sectors. Management includes Eric Grubman, who was the chairman of hospitality company On Location Experiences and also held roles with the NFL. John Collins, the acting CEO of the SPAC, spent time with the NHL and Cleveland Browns.Supernova Partners Acquisition (NASDAQ: SPNV) is targeting the technology sector, looking for a company with a large addressable market, a well-defined vision, competitive moats and the ability to scale its operations. The management team includes Spencer Rascoff, the co-founder of Zillow Group (NASDAQ: Z) and Hotwire. Rascoff was the CEO of Zillow for over 10 years and led the company through 15 acquisitions including large rival Trulia. A SPAC from Goldman Sachs could land a high growth company, including eToro who was in recent talks with the company. GS Acquisition Holdings Corp II (NASDAQ: GSAH) is still trading under $11 and was a top pick from Hoch. The SPAC raised $700 million and did not specify a target area of focus. Churchill Capital Corp IV (NASDAQ: CCIV) is one of the largest SPACs currently seeking a target. The SPAC is linked as a finalist in the bidding for DIRECTV, being sold by AT&T (NYSE: T). Hoch favors the valuation of the SPAC trading closer to $10. Landing DIRECTV wouldn't be a great deal, according to Hoch, and he said he would be more excited about a different target. Cerberus Telecom Acquisition (NYSE: CTAC) is a SPAC led by CEO Tim Donahue, who is the former chairman of Sprint Nextel. Hoch calls it a long-term play based off of the chart.

For the full year though, the Dow was up about 6%, the S&P 500 was more than 14% higher, and the Nasdaq saw a gain of more than 41%. Not bad for a year that saw a market collapse in March.The year ended with progress on a third COVID-19 vaccine, continued political bickering in Washington and signs of life in the movie industry. Also, the ecommerce colossus had success with a new endeavor, the electric vehicle leader is poised to expand and a top chipmaker's days may be numbered.The year's end is also a time to look forward, with market themes to watch and predictions about the FAANG stocks, cryptocurrency and so much more.Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look.Bulls In Jayson Derrick's "3 Reasons Why Gene Munster Says Apple Will Be A Top Performer In 2021," see why this noted tech expert and venture capitalist believes that some key catalysts will help drive Apple Inc.

See what should give investors plenty of reason for optimism this year.Priya Nigam's "Why KeyBanc Is Turning Bullish On Continental Resources" focuses on why petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company Continental Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CLR) is now well positioned and could reinstate its dividend this year.For additional bullish calls of the past week, also have a look at the following:  * The S&P 500 Just Did Something That Has Been Bullish Every Time Since WWII  * 3 Catalysts That Could Drive Stock Prices Higher In 2021  * Tilson: Frothy Stock Market Could Still Be 'One To Two Years From The Top'In Shanthi Rexaline's "Intel Analyst: Challenges In 2021 Look 'Substantial'," see how one analyst expects formerly leading chipmaker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) to respond to activist pressure to make big changes.

But it nonetheless is a real cryptocurrency and therefore just as capable of delivering returns as Bitcoin.Dogecoin also recently got a boost after Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned it on Twitter, albeit in a non-flattering light.The altcoin may also have gotten a boost by a tweet from adult film star Angela White, who said she's been an investor since 2014.

While the 13-nation group has slashed output since April to buoy prices in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, Iran is exempt from a quota due to the sanctions.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

What Are ETFs? ETF stands for exchange-traded fund. An ETF is an investment fund whose shares trade on a stock exchange just like stocks for individual companies. ETFs track an index or sector, represent a commodity (like gold, oil or wheat) or sample a basket of stocks or bonds that meet given criteria.Exchange-traded funds are popular with investors given they can help mitigate risk in a portfolio.The QQQ ETF tracks the NASDAQ 100, which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange based on market capitalization. The fund and the index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually.With 48% of QQQ's weighted allocation stemming from the information technology sector, it's no surprise that after hitting a 2020 low of $165 in March, QQQ closed 2020 just shy of $314.As of publishing, QQQ's five largest holdings are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) (13.39% of allocation), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) (10.76%), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) (10.66%), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB) (4.26%) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) (3.45%).QQQ Forecast 2021 In our survey, 63% of Benzinga traders and investors said the QQQ ETF would reach $400 by the end of 2021.Being that QQQ representation is heavily dependent on and allocated towards tech, healthcare and consumer services, investors told us they believe the ETF will grow alongside an improving US economy in 2021, as well as a continued surge in demand and interest for the ETF's most popular stocks -- Tesla, Apple and Amazon.Respondents also believe QQQ will see strength throughout 2021 given that the sector allocation of the ETF's NASDAQ-100 representation is dominated by information technology (48%), communication services (19%) and consumer discretionary (19%) stocks.If the US economy were to improve throughout 2021, it can be said that information techology, communication services and consumer discretionary sectors stand to gain the most in the coming months.See Also: Blue Chip Stocks.This survey was conducted by Benzinga in December 2020 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Will Shopify Stock Reach ,000 By 2022?  * Will Zoom Or Cisco Stock Grow More By 2022?(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

The brands will keep their badges and logos, Reuters reported earlier.Why It Matters: The company expects its greater scale to give it an edge in an industry undergoing vehicle electrification with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) gaining all the spotlight, and facing challengers from outside, including possibly Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).But the auto industry has a mixed record of results from big mergers, including one of the brands involved in this one -- Chrysler. Daimler-Benz's purchase of Chrysler in 1998 is the classic example that merger skeptics point to as evidence that scale doesn't always work in the industry.PSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares is expected to take on the task of cutting costs at Stellantis. He "takes a Darwinian view on the industry, arguing that only the strong carmakers will survive the pivot to electric drivetrains and pursuit of autonomous driving," Bloomberg reported. His experience in reviving PSA and the brand Opel are pointed to as encouraging signs that he can manage the transformational challenges the company faces.Recent Trading Action: Shares of Fiat ended the last trading week of 2020 up 1.74% at $18.09. PSA Group trades as Peugeot SA on the Euronext Paris exchange and ended the week down 0.49% at ?22.37.

2021-01-04 05:14:55 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-04 05:14:55 and 2021-01-04 07:05:41+00:00: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) announced Monday it would host its "Galaxy Unpacked" event to launch flagship Galaxy S devices on Jan. 14, a month earlier than expected.What Happened: In the past, Samsung unveiled its flagship phones in February, either before or during the Mobile World Congress trade show, and released the devices in March or April, CNET reports. This year, the smartphone maker has picked an early launch date.At the "Galaxy Unpacked" event, Samsung is expected to unveil its newest Galaxy S devices. It will likely have three models, rumored to be the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra, as per CNET.The world's largest smartphone maker's teaser video does not reveal any details. Still, leaked images show that the devices are expected to be similar to the Galaxy S20 lineup, except for size, The Verge reports.Why It Matters: Though Samsung was one of the first companies to release a 5G smartphone in 2020, analysts expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) to become the world's second-biggest 5G vendor after Huawei, putting Samsung at the third spot, CNET noted. Apple's latest iPhone 12 lineup supports 5G.Samsung reported its highest quarterly revenue in the third quarter in October but the company said it expected intense competition in the fourth quarter.Samsung's president and head of mobile communications business, TM Roh, said in a December blog post that the company defies a "one size fits all" mobile experience. Roh added that Samsung would expand its foldable smartphone portfolio and make the devices "more accessible to everyone" in 2021.Price Action: Samsung Electronics shares rose 2.7% in South Korea on Monday.For news coverage in Italian or Spanish, check out Benzinga Italia and Benzinga Espa?a.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * OnePlus To Release Smartwatch In Early 2021(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Discovery's subscription video on demand (SVOD) services would cost $5 per month with online commercials and $7 per month without the ads.What Happened: According to a Financial Times publication, Discovery's online streaming services will launch in the U.S. and multiple European nations like Italy and Netherlands beginning Monday. With the release, Discovery will compete directly with other streaming platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple TV+, or Amazon Inc's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video. Discovery's SVOD will cover various programs from nature shows to cooking shows along with beaming channels like Animal Planet, TLC, and the flagship Discovery Channel.Why Does It Matter: For its success, Discovery Plus is relying on its ?1.3 billion deal to broadcast the Tokyo Olympics until 2024 across Europe. The FT post said that broadcasting live sporting events could position Discovery to lead other SVOD platforms. The billion-dollar deal was struck between the mass media company and Discovery's sports network -- Eurosport.Frank Godard, an analyst with Enders Analysis, is skeptical about Discovery's approach since sporting events are generally spread out over a long period of two or more years.FT quoted him, saying, "The Olympics may be an opportunity to raise the profile of Discovery Plus, but they will need distribution deals with major pay-TV operators and telcos for sustained subscriber growth."Price Action: DISCA stock closed 0.94% higher at $30.09 on Thursday.Image Courtesy: WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Apple Supplier Foxconn Looks To Invest 0M In Chinese EV Startup Byton: Report  * FAA Introduces New Rules For Commercial Drone Usage(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Here's hoping you had a great holiday season and feel ready for another exciting year of these fascinating financial markets.The calendar is new, but the same old pandemic continues to cloud the economic outlook and, let's face it, life as a whole. Last year may have been good for many investors, but it was tough for millions who lost jobs and battled illness during this tragedy. Let's hope for better times ahead.At least the market is consistent. It's starting 2021 right where it finished 2020--on the upswing. That's the case early Monday, anyway, but there are a lot of unanswered questions going into the week and the year following double-digit Q4 gains for the major indices. As 2021 gets underway, a key question is whether some of the trends that helped define last year's market can spill over. For instance, there was a record boom in new public offerings, investor margin debt rose to an all-time high, and so-called "stay at home" stocks delivered amazing results. Meanwhile, the market spent most of November and December pricing in a pretty rosy 2021, partly based on vaccines. All these trends face question marks. Right now there's this great expectation. The downside--if you want to call it that--is can things really live up to what everyone is expecting? What happens to the overall market? How does the vaccine roll-out proceed after a slow start? Do investors keep their "risk-on" attitude that dominated late 2020? Can pandemic favorites like Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON) and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) continue the growth they've had after the world returns to normal? These are among the questions facing investors as they return from their holiday break. Wall Street kicks off 2021 with a familiar tone: Stocks climbed in pre-market trading, spurred on by firmness in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) after TSLA reported nearly 500,000 deliveries last year and optimism grew about demand for MRNA's vaccine.November Long Gone, But Voting Back In Headlines Those hoping to ease into the new year will likely be disappointed. The first week of 2021 looks busy on Wall Street, so if you plan on trading consider keeping close tabs on a bunch of data and geopolitical events coming down the pike. Buckle in.First, there's the Georgia runoff election tomorrow. This will determine who controls the Senate the next two years and potentially a lot of tax and regulatory initiatives. It could even help decide whether there's another round of stimulus and how big it might be. As noted here last week, it's possible stocks could suffer a post-holiday hangover if Democrats prevail, only because Wall Street tends to view Democratic control as more likely to bring higher taxes and regulation, though there's no guarantee of either (see more below). We're also jumping right back into the data pool starting tomorrow with ISM manufacturing for December. The week wraps up with December nonfarm payrolls on Friday. Do you want the good news or bad news first? The good news is that analysts' expectations for ISM look solid. The bad news is they think job creation took it on the chin in December.Headline ISM manufacturing--a key metric that's been on the upswing since mid-2020--is expected at 56.4% when the report comes out tomorrow morning, according to research firm Briefing.com. That's down just a smidgen from 57.5% in November and would probably be viewed as market-neutral. Remember, anything above 50% is expansionary. New orders and order backlog were strong in November, so keep an eye on those numbers to see if the positive trends continued. We'll talk more about the payrolls report later this week so you can avoid potential sour news your first day back from the holiday. Let's just say if analysts are right, it looks like it might be the weakest in eight months.Good News May Be Built In To Some Extent While job growth might be lagging, the stock market starts 2021 at valuations that look pretty high from a historic perspective. Major indices are way above their long-term moving averages and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) trades at 22.5 times analysts' average earnings estimates for 2021. Many big banks predict smaller gains in the major indices this year based on the fact that some of the anticipated better earnings and economic news might already be reflected in the market. For now, a level to watch could be 3750 in the SPX. That had been technical resistance toward the end of 2020, and the market closed just above it to finish the old year. Any move below 3750 could conceivably generate some spillover selling, but closing above it could give the bulls more confidence. Earnings season doesn't open until mid-month, but that doesn't mean some companies don't get out ahead. This week's earnings calendar includes Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA), Conagra Brands Inc (NYSE: CAG), and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU). That means investors hear from a Dow Jones Industrial Average member (WBA) and a closely watched semiconductor firm that increased guidance last month (MU).In other corporate news, The Wall Street Journal reported that Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU) is in talks to buy the rights to content from streaming service Quibi. This news seems to be giving ROKU shares some momentum early Monday.CHART OF THE DAY: WORKING ABOVE THE NET. The S&P 500 Index (SPX--candlestick) climbed above its 200-day moving average (blue line) last June and hasn't really looked back. Its current 16% premium to the closely watched 200-day MA has some analysts worried about possible overbought conditions, but others say low-interest rates and hopes of an economic revival later this year could justify high prices. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Be Prepared--Volatility Often Perks Up Early in Year: Volatility slipped on Wall Street toward late December, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) slipping to near its post-pandemic lows. That might not last. At some point we're likely going to start to have volatility again related to COVID-19. This is not a story that's necessarily going away in the first six months of 2021. Especially considering the record hospitalizations being recorded and this new strain of the virus that's been making headlines. If there are any stumbles on vaccine logistics, volatility could go up even more.In fact, in recent years, volatility has often climbed in late January and early February after a slow start. This was true even before the pandemic. Look at what happened in 2018 and 2020, when VIX soared at that time of year. Past events don't guarantee the future, but it's worth noting this emerging seasonal trend. VIX ticked up slightly Monday to start the year. Gridlock Threatened: In a normal year, election drama would be way behind us by now. Of course, 2020 was anything but normal, so Georgia voters go to the polls in two Senate races tomorrow. Nearly two months ago--after the election resulted in split control of Washington-- we wrote about how gridlock can often be beneficial for stocks, especially sectors where a divided government might not get much done. Keeping current levels of regulation and market-favorable tax laws stood to possibly benefit certain sectors like Health Care, Energy, and Financials, as well as help investors who wouldn't necessarily have to worry about higher capital gains taxes. Tomorrow's election potentially puts gridlock at risk. Though this isn't a political column, it wouldn't be prudent (as one recent U.S. president liked to say) to ignore the voting. A sweep by the two Democrats would mean Democratic control of the Senate, House and White House. No matter what your politics, it's hard to deny that historically having Democrats in control has often led to more regulation and higher taxes (the 2009-2010 Democratic Congress passed numerous bank laws and the Affordable Care Act, all signed by Democratic P

2021-01-06 13:05:15 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-06 13:05:15 and 2021-01-06 14:46:08+00:00: Investors woke up to an unfamiliar sight Wednesday: The 10-year Treasury yield is back above 1% for the first time since last March.Yields rocketed higher while stocks looked mixed as Democrats took one Georgia Senate seat and led narrowly in the other Georgia Senate race with thousands of votes left to count. Strength in yields could reflect ideas that if Democrats do gain ground, another fiscal stimulus and increased Washington spending could grow more likely.All this is speculation, and no one should be thinking that anything--including the makeup of the Senate as well as new policy priorities--is a done deal. We'll know at some point who won, so let's focus on what's happening right now.There's the 10-month high in 10-year yields, obviously, and crude hit an 11-month high above $50 a barrel. That happened after Saudi Arabia surprised everyone with a voluntary one million barrel-per-day production cut, according to media reports. The jump in yields appeared to strengthen Financial shares including Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM). Back at home, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) is taking it on the chin as some of the big stocks there like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) come under pressure in premarket trading. Why? Well, if it's a 50-50 Senate (with a Democratic tie-breaker), there's concern about more regulation on the Tech sector.At the same time, Financial stocks and the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-caps are up early on. These parts of the market could get a shot in the arm from higher rates and stimulus hopes if Democrats do extend their lead. Banks benefit from higher rates because it tends to help their profit margins, while the RUT is more exposed to the domestic economy than other indices and also has a big population of regional bank stocks. More government spending (if there's another stimulus) would likely help keep yields elevated.In the world of individual stocks, some that might benefit from Democratic control include solar energy companies and electric cars. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares climbed in pre-market trading, and so did shares of a bunch of solar firms. You could make a bullish case for either side winning. The bullish case for Democrats is more short-term (the chance for more stimulus), but a Republican victory might be longer-term bullish if it leads to more Washington spending discipline.Trading could be choppy today as investors watch the votes roll in. It's kind of interesting, though, to see the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) a little lower this morning after it flirted with 30 earlier this week. Keep an eye on that if a final call gets made in Georgia.Turnaround Tuesday As Peach State Votes After starting the year with a selloff, the market turned things around Tuesday thanks in part to leadership from the small-cap RUT and so-called "value" sectors like Energy and Financials. The RUT outpaced every other major index, gaining nearly 2% after a 2020 that saw it recover from early weakness to have a better year than the large-cap S&P 500 Index (SPX).A selloff in bonds yesterday might have gotten the party started both for Financials and the RUT (which has a large contingent of regional banks among its leading stocks). The market wavered and drifted up until early afternoon, and then saw a buying wave come in that lifted almost all the sectors.Some decent data might have helped too, especially ISM manufacturing (see more below). The election was on investors' minds, and it's interesting to see how small-caps--which tend to be more sensitive to domestic fiscal policy--rallied Tuesday as voting took place.What Else Is Happening? Earnings Reports, Payrolls Data Ahead Beyond the election and yesterday's rally, this week is packed with data and even a few earnings reports.Tomorrow, investors are expecting to hear from Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU), Conagra Brands Inc (NYSE: CAG), and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA). All three of these firms have direct consumer exposure. Don't know what CAG sells? Think about a bunch of stuff that might be in your pantry, including Slim Jims, Duncan Hines, Hunts', and Vlasic. Yep, tomorrow we'll get a better sense of how meat sticks, canned tomatoes, pickles, and cake mixes performed in CAG's most recent quarter, and this is one of those rare companies whose stock has pretty much flatlined over the last year.That can't be said for WBA, one of the worst performers of 2020 and a prominent one because it's listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI). It was the second-worst performer in the $DJI last year after finishing last in 2019. The company's been hurt by more people getting prescriptions delivered by mail, which means fewer people coming in and browsing at stores. Some analysts think the stock has gotten oversold and may be able to top Wall Street's estimates. We shall see.Data-wise, the week kicked off with a really nice read on December ISM Manufacturing, which came in well above analysts' expectations Tuesday at 60.7%. That topped November's 57.5%, and was way above Wall Street's average estimate of 56.4%. Believe it or not, the headline figure is now just 10 basis points below the recent high of 60.8% recorded in 2018, Briefing.com pointed out. Anything above 50% shows expansion, and manufacturing data often points toward future demand from businesses and consumers. This looks like a green shoot after some disappointing data over the last few weeks.The big number this week is nonfarm payrolls--arguably the most closely-watched number each month--due out ahead of the bell Friday. See below for more insight into what that important report might show.Something else to watch could be this new strain of virus reported recently in South Africa. It's still early, but some scientists are worried about how it will respond to vaccines. Just keep in mind that if scientists do determine it's less responsive, that could make for some ugliness in the markets. Obviously there's no reason to panic, but just another uncertainty to factor into your thinking.CHART OF THE DAY: CRUDE SPUTTERING AT $50. Will there be enough momentum to push crude oil futures (/CL--candlestick) above $50 (yellow horizontal line) per barrel? If there is, there is potential for further upside movement perhaps to the high of $54.66, the high reached in February 2020. If /CL doesn't break above $50, it could fall back within its $47-$48 trading range. Data source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Thanks for the Raise: The new year brings higher pay for many, as 20 states raised their minimum wages on Jan. 1. The debate has raged for decades and probably will continue about whether doing this helps or hurts workers, businesses, and the economy. Also, with the pandemic raging and numerous shutdowns, it's going to be hard to see an immediate impact. Some might argue that it could present an additional burden on small businesses, for that matter.Still, if vaccinations get things back on a more normal footing and local shops and restaurants see some recovery, rising wages could put extra dollars in employees' pockets, helping consumer demand down the road. The biggest minimum wage increase is in New Mexico, where it goes from $9 to $10.50. The corollary to this is high levels of consumer debt after the holiday season, which has some economists worried. If consumers are looking at empty pocketbooks as they try to pay their holiday bills, spending levels could get muted in coming weeks. Watch Your Wallet: Investors expecting an economic recovery often turn to the Consumer Discretionary sector, hoping shoppers will feel more spending power. Since last June--with data generally improving from the virus-related lows--Consumer Discretionary improved too. It rose almost 26%, beating all but two other S&P 500 sectors over that time frame.

2021-01-06 13:22:23 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-06 13:22:23 and 2021-01-06 15:06:37+00:00: In a surprising turn of events, Democrats appear poised to take over control of the Senate, potentially setting up at least two years of full Democratic control in Washington.What Happened? On Tuesday, Georgia held two Senate runoff elections. As of Wednesday morning, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock is the projected victor in one of the two Georgia Senate runoff races, while Democrat Jon Ossoff maintains a narrow lead in a second race that is still too close to call with an estimated 98% of the votes already tallied at publication time.Why It's Important: Online prediction market PredictIt now estimates Democrats have a 97% chance of gaining control of the Senate. Two Democratic victories in Georgia would split the Senate 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris getting the tie-breaking vote.Analysts and experts say Democratic control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives would be great news for the Democratic agenda, but Democrats will have zero wiggle room on more progressive legislation.In the near-term, President-elect Joe Biden has reportedly said Senate control would potentially allow him to make more progressive cabinet picks.Investor Impact: Two areas in which investors could see a positive impact from a Democratic victory could be cannabis stocks and clean energy stocks. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Pablo Zuanic said Democratic control of the Senate could be a "game changer" for cannabis stocks."We go from speculating what President-elect Biden could have done for cannabis reform via Executive Order (or by directives/'memos' from his incoming Attorney General) and if the Senate would have held a vote on the SAFE act (banking reform) would have even taken a vote, to a new world, in which the question is more about the timing and scope of much broader reform for the cannabis industry," Zuanic wrote in a note this week.He said Trulieve Cannabis Corp (OTC: TCNNF) and Curaleaf Holdings Inc (OTC: CURLF) remain his top two stock picks among U.S. multi-state operators.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the outcome in Georgia could be great news for electric vehicle stocks and bad news for big tech stocks."To be blunt, it's a clear negative for Big Tech as ultimately with a Senate now likely controlled by Democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around FAANG names with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table," Ives wrote in a note.Shares of Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and other target tech stocks initially traded lower by more than 2% on Wednesday morning.Ives said EV stocks like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Fisker Inc (NYSE: FSR) have a lot to gain from the Democratic sweep."We believe a doubling down on EV tax credits and further consumer incentives and government initiatives around the EV sector will be on the horizon which is a major positive for Tesla, GM, Fisker, and other auto players/EV supply chain (QS, etc.)," Ives said.All three stocks opened higher on Wednesday morning.Benzinga's Take: Wall Street initially appeared to see more overall negatives to a Democratic victory than positives, likely due to concerns over higher taxes and a potential increase in regulation. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) opened Wednesday's session down about 0.5%, but was trading in positive territory at publication time.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 4 Reasons The Stock Market Rally Could Resume In 2021  * S&P 500 Has Only Been This Expensive One Other Time ?

It allows users to work out anytime anywhere, a welcome proposition at a time when staying at home is preferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. An analyst at Rosenblatt Securities said that awareness of the new offering -- though growing -- trails the rival offering by Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON).Home Fitness Here To Stay: A workout at home is preferred by a majority, with most suggesting they will continue to maintain or increase this routine post the pandemic, analyst Bernie McTernan said in a note, citing the results of Rosenblatt's third Streaming Fitness survey.About 45% of the respondents said they use a streaming home fitness service, the analyst said, adding that 23% of the respondents use a free service, 14% use Apple Fitness+, 10% rely on Peloton and 15% use a paid service other than those of Apple and Peloton.Peloton Tops Apple In Awareness:  Awareness of Apple Fitness+ stood at 52% of the respondents compared to a relatively stable 68% for Peloton, McTernan said.Awareness about Apple Fitness+ is higher among respondents with an Apple Watch at 76% compared to 41% for those without, the analyst said. Despite Apple Fitness+ being offered as a free service to Apple Watch owners for a month and for new Apple Watch buyers for three months, only less than one-quarter of those with an Apple Watch are trying Apple Fitness, he said. Related Link:  Good Fit': Street Reacts To Peloton's 0M Precor Acquisition Peloton's Low Penetration An Opportunity:  Given Peloton's product quality and focus on affordability, the low penetration of its streaming fitness service could be an opportunity, McTernan said.Peloton's moat is its content, with the company releasing 130 workouts over the last week relative to 24 by Apple Fitness+, adding to its considerable library lead, the analyst said. "On affordability, while we are focused on the launch of the value tread in February/March in the U.S., we also see an opportunity for a certified pre-owned market," he said. McTernan has a Buy rating and $186 price target for Peloton shares.AAPL, PTON Price Action:  At last check, Apple shares were moving down 2.66% at $127.53 and Peloton shares were slipping 3.53% to $143.28.

The U.S. trade body published individual findings report for each of the three countries on its website.Many of the U.S. tech giants including Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) fall under the purview of these DST regulations.India levies a 2% tax liability for revenues generated locally through digital platforms and online content, software-as-a-service, etc. Italy is imposing a 3% tax rate on the total taxable revenues, whereas Turkey introduced the possibility of raising the maximum allowable tax rate to 15%. Turkey's current DST rate is 7.5%.Why It Matters: According to Bloomberg, the Czech Republic and Spain will begin digital tax collections from January 2021, while other European countries like Norway, Belgium, and Latvia will initiate the rule this year.The USTR kicked off the Section 301 investigations against these three countries in June 2020, in tandem with the DST considerations in Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Indonesia, Spain, and the United Kingdom per the press release.France carried through with its local version of the DST in 2019, and after talks with President Donald Trump faltered, began collecting in mid-December 2020. The USTR pondered implementing a 25% tariff levy on certain French products with an estimated total import value of $1.3 billion per year, reports Reuters.Price Action: On Thursday, AMZN closed 2.49% lower at $3,138.38, FB was down 2.83% to $263.21, AAPL fell 3.32% at $126.66, and GOOG closed at $1,735.29 with a 0.32% decrease.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Walgreens Sells Pharmacy Wholesale Unit To AmerisourceBergen For .5B  * Waymo Ditches The Term 'Self-Driving,' Taking Apparent Aim At Tesla(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Get behind them don't sell a share just let them create value," advised Palihapitiya.Why It Matters: Palihapitiya repeated his thesis that Tesla is a disruptive company whose primary value is about "deregulating energy" and is not just an automaker.The investment guru made a "fairly large" investment in Tesla in 2016 and has said that Tesla would become a trillion-dollar company on the scale of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).Price Action: On Thursday, Tesla shares closed nearly 7.9% higher at $816.04 and rose 1.65% in the after-hours session to $829.50.

The company's financials are scheduled for release on Jan 14.For the period between October to December 2020, Apple suppliers exhibit strong confidence of beating revenue expectations. Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (OTC: HNHPF) booked higher than expected revenues for that period, and Apple's U.K. headquartered supplier Dialogue Semiconductor PLC (OTC: DLGNF) has raised sales forecasts.Price Action: TSM shares are up 2.40% at $124.35, hitting a new 52-week high in the pre-market session on the last check Friday.Image Courtesy: WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * AmEx Faces Three-Pronged Federal Investigation Over Card Sales Practices: WSJ  * Tencent-Backed Tuhu Seeking Fresh Funding At B Valuation: Report(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-08 14:10:52 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-08 14:10:52 and 2021-01-08 15:49:49+00:00: GM Execs Talk EVs General Motors (NYSE: GM) executives said in a press conference on Wednesday that the company will reveal details of its upcoming electric vehicles at the virtual CES trade show next week. General Motors already announced last year it aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles in 2025. With an investment of $27 billion, GM showed its commitment to fight to become number one in North America.A decade ago, GM was the company to beat in the U.S. in electric vehicles, but Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), which joined the blue-chip S&P 500 last month, has since smashed that record with its Model 3. Although this is just a sliver of the overall U.S. vehicle market, it was enough to turn the 112-year-old GM into an underdog as Tesla has emerged a the dominant player in the U.S. EV market.At a value of $600 billion, Tesla's market capitalization is now 10 times that of GM. Unlike traditional automakers, it is a pure-play electric vehicle company. GM could face future costs if the pollution emitted by internal combustion engines starts being seen as a long-term liability, which would trigger more regulation, legislation and litigation. This is why some investors think the automaker might still spin off its EV business, despite GM's statements to the contrary.Ideanomics Acquires WAVE On January 5th, Ideanomics (NASDAQ: IDEX) revealed it signed a definitive agreement to acquire WAVE, a leading provider of wireless charging systems for commercial EVs. The fully automated WAVE system eliminates battery range limitations and enables EVs to achieve driving ranges that match that of internal combustion engines. Moreover, WAVE enables electric vehicles to achieve the same driving ranges like that of internal combustion engines. Fast, safe and in-route charging is key to enable the wider adoption of EVs for them to actually have a shot at replacing ICE vehicles.Apple And Hyundai The news of a potential partnership between Hyundai Motor Company (PInk: HYMTF) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported by the Korea Economic Daily and confirmed by Hyundai to Bloomberg have sent Hyundai's shares up more than 20% on the Korea Exchange on Friday. Last month, Reuters reported that Apple's car initiative, Project Titan, is on track with plans to develop an autonomous electric passenger vehicle and launch it by 2024.There's no doubt that EVs are the future. The question remains how long it will take for the automotive reality to become all-electric. A Democrat-controlled Senate could pave the way for new EV incentives, boosting EV development in which both traditional automakers and new entrants are investing heavily. As for traditional automakers, they still have a long way to go if they want to pass Tesla in the North American electric vehicle market.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) discontinued services to Parler. Apple removed it from its App Store, and Amazon stopped providing cloud hosting services through Amazon Web Services.Parler had risen to the No. 1 most-downloaded spot in the App Store in the days prior to the removal, as Twitter cracked down similarly on right-wing extremist content.Amazon employees earlier in the day had demanded the move, saying they did not want to be associated with a platform that had been used by organizers of Wednesday's riots at the U.S. Capitol. Why It Matters: The moves add to a steady stream of moves among companies seeking to distance themselves from violent content on Parler. On Friday, Twitter permanently removed Donald Trump's account because of his involvement in inciting the riot, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) removed Parler from its Google Play store.  Apple sent a letter to Parler prior to the removal from the App Store, warning it of discontinued service if better content moderation wasn't implemented within 24 hours. Apple found Parler's subsequent response lacking.Parler Chief Executive John Matze said Parler may be down for a week as the moves, especially that of Amazon, hobble the technical underpinnings of the site.Rebekah Mercer, daughter of hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and a backer of conservative causes, is reportedly an investor in Parler.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * California Man Sues Robinhood Over Last Year's Hacking Of Customer Accounts, Seeks Class-Action Status  * Boeing 737 Crashes After Takeoff From Indonesian Capital Of Jakarta (Update)(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

The company is taking aim at high-end competitors with the technology, performance and user experience features it announced.What Happened:  The premium-priced ET7 sedan is positioned against cars from traditional luxury automakers such as Bayerische Motoren Werke ADR (OTC: BMWYY) and Daimler ADR's (OTC: DMLRY) Mercedez Benz and Audi units, which is majority owned by Volkswagen A G Unsponsored Represent 1 10th Sh ADR (OTC: VWAGY). That's according to Nio founder, Chairman and CEO William Li, who spoke after the event, as reported by Chinese media outlet Sina.com.cn and in English by  cnTech Post.The ET7 could even be a competitor to the car that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is rumored to be contemplating, Li reportedly said.Related Link:  Nio To Match Vehicle Prices Through Jan. 10 As China Plans 20% EV Subsidy Cut In 2021 The ET7 will not go up against Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S, as both are not in the same class, just as Nio's ES8 and ES6 SUVs are not pitched against the Model X, according to Sina.com.cn.Click  here  to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicles news.Separately, Nio cofounder and President Lihong Qin said, according to a tweet by Moneyball, that the company is not facing mass order cancellations now that Tesla has begun accepting orders for its China-made Model Y. Qin reportedly said the company's customers wait six to eight weeks for its vehicles and that there has been no large-scale order cancellation, contrary to some media reports.Benzinga's Take: Nio's ET7 is billed as a best-in-class sedan, with the only shortcoming being its premium pricing.Given burgeoning demand for EVs in China, Nio's increasing brand recognition and the company's innovative schemes such as Battery-as-a-Service and Autonomous Driving-as-a-Service that reduce costs for customers, the ET7 is likely to see a fairly robust uptake.Related Link:  Tesla To Launch $25,000 EV Sedan In China By 2022: Report See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Nio Day 2020: EV Maker Shows Off ET7 Sedan, New Power Swap Station, 150kWh Battery Pack, ADaaS And More  * Apple Could Be Looking At More Partnerships In EV Quest: Analyst(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

The vehicle's standard edition is priced at $69,185 before subsidies. The sedan will pitch Nio against high-end competitors but not against market leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).The car may also offer competition to an EV made by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) who is likely to forge a partnership with Korea's Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) as early as March, according to an unconfirmed report. Price Action: Nio shares closed nearly 8.5% higher at $58.92 on Friday and gained 0.24% in the after-hours session.Related Link: Baidu Confirms Joining China EV Fray In Partnership With Volvo-Parent GeelyClick here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicles news.

Stripe terms state that it does not process payments for "high risk" activities including any business or organization that "engages in, encourages, promotes or celebrates unlawful violence or physical harm to persons or property."Why It Matters: Last week, outgoing President Donald Trump's supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol.Since the violence, several tech companies issued permanent bans on Trump including Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR). Several platforms have since then either removed Trump's accounts or accounts associated with pro-Trump violence, according to Axios.These include Reddit, which has banned the subreddit group "r/DonaldTrump," Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)-owned Twitch, and Shopify Inc (NASDAQ: SHOP), which has removed two stores affiliated with Trump's organization and his campaign.Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) video streaming service YouTube is fast-tracking enforcement against election misinformation.Earlier, Alphabet, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon stopped services to Parler, the conservative alternative to Twitter.Snap Inc.'s (NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat has also disabled Trump's account as of Wednesday. Pinterest says it is limiting hashtags such as StopTheSteal.Photo by Gage Skidmore on FlickrSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Nio Could Make Cheaper EVs To Capture Mass-Market But Under Different Brand: CEO  * Baidu Confirms Joining China EV Fray In Partnership With Volvo-Parent Geely(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

If any Republicans or Democrats object, the resolution will go to the floor for a roll call vote on Tuesday, following which Pence will be given 24 hours to invoke the 25th Amendment. Bloomberg reports that Pence has dismissed the idea of using the 25th Amendment.If Pence denies, House will move with the impeachment legislation vote on Wednesday, making it likely that Trump would be the first president to be impeached twice.Though many Republicans have criticized Trump for his role in the Capitol Hill riots, no one has said they would convict him of wrongdoing in the Senate, saying impeachment was not the best way forward to hold Trump accountable, the Financial Times reports.Why It Matters: As per NBC News reporter Hallie Jackson, Trump didn't reach out to Mike Pence on Wednesday night -- nor has he called Pence since.Though the House could vote by Wednesday, it could delay sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate to allow the chamber to prioritize President-elect Joe Biden's cabinet nominees and other legislative matters.Trump has been banned from using social media by major tech companies. Parler, the conservative alternative to Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), continues to see itself cut off from major tech services like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN).A second impeachment vote will prevent Trump from holding office again but winning a Senate vote would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, FT notes.Image Courtesy: WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Why Are Markets Talking About 'Reflation Trade'?

(NASDAQ: AMZN) cut off the social media platform from its cloud-hosting service Amazon Web Services.What Happened: The e-commerce giant had given Parler a 24-hour notice late Saturday, saying it couldn't "provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others," as reported by TechCrunch.A group of Amazon workers had written to the company, demanding that it stops providing services to Parler.Apple Inc.

Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) to outsource partial chip production after delays in its chip fabrication processes, Bloomberg reports.What Happened: Intel had reported problems with its 7-nanometer chip manufacturing process in July 2020 and announced a delay in the rollout of its next-generation chips to 2022, 2023. The company had said it was considering outsourcing some of its chip manufacturing.Intel's CEO Bob Swan has promised investors that he would set out outsourcing plans by Jan. 21, when it reports earnings. Swan said he would get the company's production technology back on track.Though Intel is the world's best-known chipmaker, it has suffered years-long delays that have put it behind competitors that design their own chips and outsource production to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor.Why It Matters: Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have raced ahead with their own designs and TSMC's advanced production technology, Bloomberg notes."We have another great lineup of products in 2022, and I'm increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either Intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes, or a combination of both," Swan said in October 2020. TSMC is the largest maker of semiconductors for other companies. It has offered to prepare Intel chips manufactured using a 4-nanometer process, with initial testing using an older 5-nanometer process, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.TSMC will make 4-nanometer chips test production by the fourth quarter of 2021 and volume shipments by next year. As Intel keeps manufacturing its best semiconductors in-house, any outsourcing of this scale will require a potential supplier to create new capacity.Samsung is the world's biggest producer of memory chips and a competitor to TSMC. It has to look for big contracts for its foundry unit, the Financial Times reports.Bernstein analysts estimated Intel might outsource 10-30% of its CPU production in 2023 to TSMC, which would boost the latter's revenue by 5% to 10%. "Samsung may get a minor share in this business," but TSMC technology is ahead of Samsung's "with better execution," the Bernstein analysts said. Price Action: On the last check Monday, INTC shares are up 0.90% at $52.11, TSM shares are up by 3.09% at $122.36.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Samsung Picks Early Launch For Flagship Galaxy S Smartphones(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

The stock price moved down to $129.62 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-22  * Strike Price: $128.00  * Volume: 2862  * Open Interest: 4026Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset."Out of the money" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. "Out of the money" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are "bullish" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are "bearish" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 10 Information Technology Stocks With Unusual Options Alerts In Today's Session  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

The multiyear observational research study, which will enroll young and aging patients, is scheduled for launch this year. The study's primary objectives are to develop digital biomarkers to help monitor cognitive performance over time and identify early signs of MCI.Related Link:  The Week Ahead In Biotech (Jan 10-16): Expect Stocks To Move As J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Kicks Off Why It's Important:  Declines in cognitive health affect about 15%-20% of adults over the age of 65. Diagnosis often is delayed, and it can take months to years before cognitive decline is detected."Cognitive decline can be an early symptom of neurodegenerative diseases and dementia. The successful development of digital biomarkers in brain health would help address the significant need to accelerate patient diagnoses and empower physicians and individuals to take timely action," Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos said in a statement. Apple COO Jeff Williams said that in collaborating with Biogen, Cupertino hopes "this study can help the medical community better understand a person's cognitive performance by simply having them engage with their Apple Watch and iPhone."At last check, Biogen shares were up 3.19% at $260.60, while Apple was down 1.7% at $129.80.

2021-01-11 13:56:37 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-11 13:56:37 and 2021-01-11 15:31:59+00:00: Mondays might get a bad reputation on Wall Street if they keep starting out like this. For the second week in a row, stocks begin in a slump. Last week they recovered to hit new record highs by Friday, so there's that. Rising cases of coronavirus and the swirl of events around President Trump could be contributing to this early weakness. Also, the employment report last Friday didn't look all that bad when you drill down into it, but over the weekend some analysts were questioning the data and worrying about what it might reflect. Additionally, there seems to be a bit more of a "risk-off" sentiment taking shape today. Volatility is on the rise, bitcoin is down, and gold is edging higher. Bonds are holding in place, however.With earnings and data a bit thin today and tomorrow, it wouldn't be too surprising if the market keeps taking its cue from politics. Earnings season ignites later this week, but another big question hanging over Wall Street is whether Congress can push through another stimulus and if any stimulus effort conceivably could get slowed down by the current tension on Capitol Hill. Major indices continue to be driven partly by comments from senators and President-elect Biden on the prospect of another payment to Americans. Biden is expected to reveal more details of his economic package this week and wants to make it a top priority early on in his administration, media reports say. Any new information is worth watching, though it feels like Wall Street has already built in a lot of the stimulus hopes. There's also concern that the possible reverberation of last week's events in Washington might muddy the waters as the new administration tries to gain momentum on stimulus and infrastructure initiatives. One feature last week was volatility trending down after a spike to begin 2021. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) flirted with 30 a week ago but finished Friday below 22. By early Monday, it was heading back up. Investors still wait to see if VIX can get back below the historic average of 20, which it hasn't done in almost a year. If you look further out at the VIX futures complex into the February and March timeframe, it's trading in many cases above 25. So at least a lot of investors don't expect VIX to calm anytime soon. "Buy-The Dip" Sees Carryover Popularity From 2020 Lower volatility last week might have given some investors more confidence to keep "buying the dip," a trend that took hold last fall and seemed to be the case on just about every pullback the first week of the year. Take Tuesday's quick recovery from Monday's drop, and think about how quickly the major indices rebounded Friday after slipping below unchanged around midday. Nothing goes straight up forever, the saying goes. Another saying is "the trend is your friend," and few seem to be trying to fight the upward trend lately. Those who did probably got bloody noses. Last week, nothing seemed to move upward more quickly than bitcoin and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). More on TSLA below, but remember this about bitcoin: Before diving in, make sure you understand the investment. The fundamentals that drive bitcoin are a bit mysterious, so you might want to be cautious if you're considering trading it.Overall, the first week of 2021 saw decent performance from most of the less "defensive" sectors. Energy, Materials and Financials got out of the gate nicely, though Tech slipped just a bit in what may have been profit-taking after its December rally. The sectors that underperformed last week included Utilities, Real Estate, and Consumer Staples. In general, Utilities and Staples are places investors tend to park their money when they're looking for dividend yields.At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed roughly 20 basis points last week from around 91 to 111. That's a really significant move that helped Financial stocks and the Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index, and is really starting to change the tenor of the market. Rising yields tend to put pressure on dividend-generating stocks because investors who want yields can find them in the fixed income market. However, even at 1.11% the benchmark 10-year remains near historic lows, so it's early to read too much into this weakness in Utilities and Staples.A couple of individual stocks are on the move ahead of the open. Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) jumped 15% on news of positive Alzheimer's trial data. And Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) climbed 11% after it introduced a new model over the weekend. Jobs Report Redux Looking back one more time at last Friday's disappointing jobs report, it seems to have been shrugged off by Wall Street because it mostly reflected the impact of shutdowns on the leisure sector. The thinking could be that if vaccinations really get going, a lot of those jobs might come back. Also, the recent stimulus package passed by Congress didn't take effect until well after the jobs data got collected, so Washington's help for small business might have an impact starting this month. Any further stimulus could also have investors thinking December might have been a "one-timer," to use an old hockey term. We'll see. Beyond that, there was actually a bunch of stuff to like about the report, including upward revisions to October and November, along with solid growth in manufacturing, construction, transportation, and business and professional services jobs. The unemployment rate of 6.7% also was unchanged, though that can be a tricky number because it doesn't reflect people who've given up job hunting and left the workforce. In a rapidly growing economy, those people often start venturing back in, and that's why long-term unemployment remains a key number to watch if and when the virus gets under control. Most of the long-term numbers didn't change much in December, according to the Labor Department.  CHART OF THE DAY:  GOLD GOT A HAMMERING. It didn't take long for gold futures (/GC--candlestick) to lose their shiny luster. After moving in an upward channel (yellow lines) since the end of Nov. 2020, the uptrend looks to have gotten exhausted. Friday's price action saw /GC gap down below its 1900 support level, closing at $1836 per troy ounce. It's worth watching gold to see if buyers come back in or if prices continue to fall lower.

Did Slumping Jobs Picture Weigh on Retail Sales? One thing to potentially watch is how the negative jobs picture might have affected retail sales in December. That data comes out this Friday morning, and we'll preview Wall Street's estimates later this week. A big drop in retail sales can often weigh on sectors most exposed to consumers, especially Consumer Discretionary.While retail sales is a big number to keep an eye on, this week's calendar looks a little odd because it's almost completely blank Monday and Tuesday. With the earnings calendar a bit light those two days as well--aside from KB Home (NYSE: KBH) expected after the close Tuesday--investors might see a market that's slightly untethered and more vulnerable than usual to moving on news from outside of the corporate and data world. That doesn't mean hide under your desk and don't trade, only to be a little more aware that sudden swings one way or the other could occur. Once earnings begin, there's a lot to keep track of. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) is expected to report Thursday, and Friday is the big morning this week with JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). There's a lot investors can glean about the economy from watching how the banks did and listening to what their executives have to say, and we'll be talking more about what to look and listen for as the week proceeds. Stay tuned. Why $50 Crude Might Not Last: Speaking of commodities, one big development last week was crude hitting $50 a barrel for the first time since February. The question is can it l

The app was installed 7.5 million times on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android app stores between Jan. 6 and Jan. 10, according to Sensor Tower data reported by CNBC.Signal monthly installs have hit their lifetime high, but what exactly is the app and what sets its apart from rivals such as Facebook Inc's (NASDAQ: FB) WhatsApp -- which is under fire after it revised its privacy policy?What Is Signal: Signal is a messaging app that offers services on mobile phones and desktops. The app allows users to make video or voice calls along with texting. All the communications are end-to-end encrypted, which means even Signal cannot see the contents of these chats and calls. The only information that Signal collects from its users is a phone number, which means it has limited data to hand over to law enforcement authorities.> You can make an app used by many millions of people that has no data...Cool chart by @forbes & @UKZak  https://t.co/gWFqyIeoZ3 pic.twitter.com/Unngddaq5M> > -- Signal (@signalapp) January 5, 2021Shares Some Pedigree With WhatsApp: Signal is a non-profit organization, which was created by a $50 million grant from WhatsApp's founder Brian Acton. Acton left WhatsApp after Facebook acquired it in 2014 for $19 billion in cash and stock, as per Reuters.Privacy Focused: When Acton and co-founder Matthew Rosenfeld announced the launch of Signal, the latter said in a message that its mission was to "develop open source privacy technology that protects free expression and enables secure global communication.""Our plan is to pioneer a new model of technology nonprofit focused on privacy and data protection for everyone, everywhere," wrote Acton.A Different Revenue Model: Signal's non-profit model means it depends on grants and private investors for its survival. This week, Musk revealed that he had given such a grant a year ago and pledged to "donate more."Why The Controversy: WhatsApp recently unveiled a new privacy policy, which will come into effect in February. The privacy policy allegedly eliminates the choice to opt-out of data-sharing with WhatsApp parent Facebook. > We continue to shatter traffic records and add capacity as more and more people come to terms with how much they dislike Facebook's new terms. If you weren't able to create a new group recently, please try again. New servers are ready to serve you.> > -- Signal (@signalapp) January 10, 2021Forbes reported that the data to be share includes everything from battery level and browser information to the user's IP address. Facebook has since then been at pains to explain that the policy changes are to facilitate data sharing between WhatsApp and itself and does not affect consumer chats.> We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP> > -- WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) January 12, 2021Benzinga's Take: Facebook has basically shot itself in the foot at a time when the role of tech giants is under immense scrutiny.The Mark Zuckerberg-led tech giant has been explaining to users that the policy applies to business messaging, but it is the coupling of messaging and commerce that is now in the eye of the storm, as people realize their messaging platforms should afford them complete peace of mind as far as privacy is concerned.Zuckerberg & Co's privacy policy missteps are in essence for privacy-focused standalone messaging apps like Signal, or Telegram, but are unlikely to shake the domination of Facebook-owned platforms anytime soon.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Tesla Model Y Will 'Disrupt' The Chinese Auto Market ?

Now the rocket is going," said Action on the surge in Signal usage.The executive did not reveal details of the uptick but said Signal now ranks on top of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) App Store in 40 countries and Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Play Store in 18 countries. Why It Matters: Signal is run by a non-profit and is heavily privacy-centric, the app depends on grants and private investors for operations. Acton was one of the co-founders of WhatsApp and left the company after it was taken over by Facebook in 2014.Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk revealed this week that he had made a donation to Signal and would "Donate More."Musk's earlier endorsement of Signal had led to a deluge of users adopting Signal. Another bonus for Signal is the recent updates to WhatsApp's privacy policy made by parent Facebook.See Also: Elon Musk Sends Signal Downloads Soaring: What You Should Know About The AppThe updated privacy policy removes options related to data sharing with Facebook, which has led to a social media backlash against the Mark Zuckerberg-led company. Price Action: Facebook shares closed nearly 2.2% lower at $251.09 on Tuesday.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Elon Musk Sends Signal Downloads Soaring: What You Should Know About The App  * Elon Musk Discloses Funding WhatsApp Rival Signal, Says Will 'Donate More'(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

On the same day, AMD shares fell almost 4%.Cramer theorized on "Mad Money" that the change at Intel's helm presents an opportunity to buy the rival's stocks."As much as Intel needs a change, what matters here is that you're now getting a chance to buy Intel's more agile rival, AMD, down more than three bucks, for something that might not even happen: a turn at Intel within the next three years," said the analyst."I'd much rather buy the stock of a company that's beating Intel to a pulp, AMD," Cramer advocated.Why It Matters: Intel is opting to change the hands at the steering when it has lost ground to rivals like AMD, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), and lost customers like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).Cramer said that while Gelsinger -- also an Intel veteran -- did a good job at VMware, Intel needs someone "new, young, hungry who can shake up the culture, if not blow it up entirely."The former hedge fund manager praised the leadership of AMD CEO Lisa Su and acknowledged that the company under her had gone from "always second fiddle to Intel" to "being the one that makes better chips."Price Action: Intel shares closed 6.97% higher at $56.95 on Wednesday. On the same day, AMD shares closed 3.75% lower and gained 0.46% in the after-hours session.Related Link: Why The Best Outcome For Intel Shareholders Is To Break Up The ChipmakerPhoto courtesy: WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Why This Ethereum Alternative Is Grabbing Eyes Amid Crypto Markets Carnage(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Reportedly, a similar investigation is also underway in California.What Happened: The Journal cited Connecticut's Attorney General William Tong, saying Amazon's agreement with publishers is under probe for anticompetitive behavior. "Our office continues to aggressively monitor this market to protect fair competition for consumers, authors, and other e-book retailers," Tong said.Reportedly, the Connecticut authorities have sought access to documents pertaining to five of the significant publishers in the U.S, based on a subpoena filed in 2019. The Tech Transparency Project -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan watchdog organization, was the first to secure this subpoena.Why Does It Matter: With a 76% share of e-book sales in September -- based on the research by Codex Group LLC, and a dedicated Kindle business for e-book readers, Amazon is a key player in this segment.The five publishers named in the subpoena include News Corp's (NASDAQ: NWSA) HarperCollins Publishers, Hachette Book Group -- a wholly-owned subsidiary of the French media company Lagardere SCA (OTC: LGDDF), Bertelsmann SE's Penguin Random House, ViacomCBS Inc's (NASDAQ: VIAC) (NASDAQ: VIACA) publishing division Simon & Schuster and Macmillan Publishers, as per the Journal.Before the ongoing investigation against Amazon, Connecticut pursued a similar stand against Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) e-book business. At the time, a civil antitrust lawsuit was filed against five publishers and Apple, WSJ noted.Price Action: AMZN stock closed 1.44% higher at $3,165.89 Wednesday.Related News: Amazon To Face EU Antitrust Charges: ReportSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Why Amazon, Walmart, Chewy Are Letting Customers Keep Certain Items While Issuing Refunds  * USTR Criticizes India, Italy, Turkey For Digital Services Tax, Holds Off Retaliatory Action(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

It's the unofficial kickoff of earnings season before the official one tomorrow, and everyone's waiting for President-elect Biden's economic speech. With so much waiting in the wings, it's likely the market will trade like it has the last few days, without much conviction. The good news is that the unofficial earnings kickoff with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) got us off to a good start. DAL shares crept higher in pre-market trading not because its results looked all that great, necessarily, but because the company seems to be doing a decent job managing through this challenging situation. It halved the amount of cash it's burning through each day even as it operates with revenue down 65% from a year earlier. All the airlines are still works in progress for now, and DAL said 2020 was the toughest year in its history. It also said it expects to have more access to capital and return to profitability in 2021. Financials were another sector that suffered last year but seem to generally be in better shape now. Asset manager BLK shares bounced this morning before the bell as the company reported better than expected assets under management and a higher than expected quarterly profit. BLK's results--which partially reflect lively financial markets in Q4--could bode well for some of the big banks that report tomorrow and next week. It looks like the rest of the FInancial sector might be getting some early spillover support from BLK's nice quarter. Later today, keep an eye out for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who's scheduled to appear at a livestream event at 12:30 p.m. ET. It's unclear exactly what might come up for discussion, but it's always possible he could say something market moving. The market didn't move much on this morning's disappointing weekly jobless claims data, which rose to a five-month high of 965,000. This stubborn indicator just refuses to come down, speaking to more suffering around the economy. It's been mostly around 800,000 recently, so we'll soon find out if today's data is a one-time piece of bad news or something even worse. Impeachment Appears To Leave Wall Street Unfazed Stocks bounced around Wednesday with attention diverted toward impeachment for the second time in a little over a year. The swirl of events in Washington over the last week--including the impeachment vote--could raise uncertainty levels on Wall Street, which is never a good thing for the market. At the same time, there's a different dynamic playing out this time vs. when the same thing happened in late 2019 and early 2020. Today, the market is balancing what impeachment might mean even as a new administration is coming in and raising hopes for fresh stimulus. The stock market generally moved higher a year ago when the first impeachment was underway before being kneecapped by the arrival of COVID-19. Stocks also did relatively well back in 1998-99 when Congress was impeaching President Bill Clinton. Generally, it feels like everything is on pause for the moment at the cusp of earnings season and inauguration. Having next Monday as a holiday just adds to the sense that big moves aren't likely. Volatility has swung back and forth in a pretty small range since a quick climb to start the week. Once earnings begin in a major way and the new president is inaugurated--and after impeachment is resolved one way or another--it might get Wall Street back to a more normal sense of rhythm. That is, if anything could be considered normal when the pandemic continues to sink its claws into the economy and peoples' lives. Start Making Sense Sometimes things get out of sync on Wall Street, but other times they click along like clockwork. Wednesday was kind of a clockwork day, meaning some of the closely watched metrics behaved the way you might expect them to. For instance, Treasury yields pulled back and so did small-cap stocks, while Tech stocks rallied. This is what you might expect, because rising yields tend to help small-caps by reflecting expectations of a stronger domestic economy. Tech stocks had been playing defense earlier this week as yields rose and had investors worried about earnings being squeezed by higher interest rates, but found buyers Wednesday on a day when the 10-year yield fell to 1.09%. It had peaked near a 10-month high of close to 1.19% earlier in the week. The drop in yields also made sense if you consider the mild inflation data released early Wednesday. Core consumer prices rose just 0.1% in December, which was below some analysts' expectations. Year-over-year core prices were up 1.2% for the third-straight month. Not only is that well below the Fed's 2% goal, it's also a level that pretty much squelched a lot of the inflation talk that was circulating around the market earlier in the week and helping spike Treasury yields. Obviously, that doesn't mean the yield rally is over and it's clear sailing ahead on inflation worries. Some investors think yields might get a lift over the coming month or two as the new administration settles in and starts legislating. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to present his economic stimulus plan today and many investors will look closely to see how much money they're talking. Some estimates ahead of the announcement were as high as $2 trillion. If any of this money is directed into infrastructure programs or direct payments to people who are struggling, that could have a multiplier effect that helps stimulate growth but also could stimulate a bit of inflation. The Fed meeting later this month could provide investors a chance to get monetary policy makers' viewpoint on how inflationary the plan might be, but there's no indication that the Fed has any thoughts of pulling back its own stimulus anytime in the shorter term.There's more talk among economists that the Fed could start tapering the bond-buying aspect of its program perhaps by early next year if the pandemic situation is a lot better by then. The Fed has also promised to give plenty of notice long before it starts tapering, probably an attempt on its part to avoid a market "taper tantrum" like we saw back in 2013. Major indices may be hitting the "pause" button in the long rally this week, but remain just below all-time highs. The FAANGs, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) rebounded Wednesday after getting sent to the woodshed earlier this week. Many of these Tech and Communications firms are approaching their earnings dates, meaning enthusiasm could be building as investors anticipate results. A strong initial read on Christmas sales from Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) this week could be raising expectations ahead of AMZN and AAPL, both of which have heavy consumer exposure. More on consumer activity below. Speaking of Tech, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) shares got a big boost yesterday when its CEO announced plans to step down. Many investors have gotten frustrated with the chip company amid production issues, and sometimes new leadership can provide fresh perspective and new ideas of how to run things. Despite that, underlying problems don't go away just because a new person moves into the corner office. Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) replaced its CEO midway through the 737 MAX crisis, but the stock still hasn't come close to recovering all its losses. It might help in this case that INTC's incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger is a company veteran known for his technical knowledge. It would probably be a lot harder for someone without experience at INTC to quickly get a handle on the specific issues INTC faces.CHART OF THE DAY: DOLLAR'S DECLINE GIVES CRUDE AN ASSIST.

The stock price moved down to $130.01 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $130.00  * Volume: 36871  * Open Interest: 106128Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset."Out of the money" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. "Out of the money" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are "bullish" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are "bearish" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

In the latest move, U.S. has added China's leading smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (OTC: XIACF) and its third-biggest driller CNOOC Ltd (NYSE: CEO) to blacklisted firms -- baning them from American investment due to ties with the Chinese military, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.What Happened: Xiaomi was added to the Department of Defense (DoD) list of nine companies for alleged military ties. "The Department is determined to highlight and counter the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities," DoD said in a statement.Companies in the DoD list are prohibited from American exchanges and investment. As per the administration's amended order, investors have a November 2021 deadline to sell sanctioned securities.Cnooc was added to the Department of Commerce (DoC) list -- which denies access to U.S. technologies for the driller without specific permission. Bloomberg noted that the list is under an order issued in December that has blacklisted more than 60 companies."China's reckless and belligerent actions in the South China Sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarization efforts are a threat to U.S. national security and the security of the international community," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a press release."Cnooc acts as a bully for the People's Liberation Army to intimidate China's neighbors, and the Chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes."Why It Matters: Xiaomi's stock crashed 10% in Hong Kong on the news. The company hit back by saying "it provides products and services for civilian and commercial use.""The Company confirms that it is not owned, controlled, or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a 'Communist Chinese Military Company' defined under the NDAA," Xiaomi said in a statement, as per CNBC.Xiaomi is the third-largest smartphone maker globally, and this move could have future implications, CNBC notes. The smartphone has not been put on the "Entity List," which bans sanctioned companies from using American technology. Xiaomi uses chips from QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM).As per the Bloomberg report, the move against Xiaomi was unexpected, which is viewed as China's answer to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Unless the ban is reversed, Xiaomi risks being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes.So far, the government has left three major companies -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY), and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU) off the ban list considering the potential economic impact.Price Action: XIACF closed 9.35% lower at $3.88 on Thursday, and CEO closed 5.02% higher at $102.71.Related News: Top Us Banks To Remove Hong Kong-listed Products With Exposure To Sanctioned Chinese CompaniesPhoto courtesy: Ilya Plekhanov on WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Trump Administration Issues New Order Clarifying Investment Ban Against Chinese Companies  * Amazon Follows Twitter In Removing QAnon Related Products(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

"As the world begins to recover from the pandemic, having electronic access to vaccination, testing, and other medical records will be vital to resuming travel and more," said Mike Sicilia, executive vice president of Oracle's global business units. The group anticipates that a trustworthy, traceable, verifiable, and universally recognized digital record of vaccination is urgently needed.Why It Matters: The body wants to empower individuals to obtain an encrypted copy of the inoculation credentials and store it in a digital wallet of choice -- like those provided by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) unit Google.Alternatively, users could print out a paper copy of the credentials containing a QR code.

The new model is expected in both 14 and 16-inch sizes and will utilize a similar heat pipe system as the current generation 16-inch model, allowing for better performance due to more thermal headroom, Kuo said, as reported by the Verge. Kuo revealed that the design upgrade is scheduled for the third quarter of 2021.Why It Matters: In November, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant launched the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 chip at its "One More Thing" live event.See Also: Apple Highlights New M1 Chip, Shift Away From Intel At 'One More Thing' EventThe new 13-inch MacBook Pro retains the Touch Bar and comes with an identical hardware design to the previous range.Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 1.5% lower at $128.91 on Thursday and fell 0.22% in the after-hours session.

2021-01-15 13:23:11 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-15 13:23:11 and 2021-01-15 15:15:54+00:00: There's a phrase on Wall Street that investors often "buy the rumor and sell the fact."We may be seeing some of that this morning after President-elect Joe Biden late Thursday unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan that includes direct payments, increased additional federal unemployment help, state and local government aid, and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.The market has been in an uptrend in part on expectations of fresh stimulus from the Biden administration. With that priced in, investors may be taking the actual announcement as a time to book some profits. There could also be some concern about how raising the minimum wage could affect businesses at a vulnerable time while the pandemic continues.Biden's announcement came ahead of major bank earnings this morning, which investors seem to be paying close attention to as a potential gauge for how the rest of the fourth-quarter reporting season might go.Big Banks Ring The Opening Bell On Earnings Season The buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact dynamic may apply to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) as well. JPM had a tremendous quarter, with revenue topping expectations and earnings coming in at $3.79 per share when analysts had expected just $2.62. The strong quarter came as the bank was able to unwind some of its loan loss provisions and trading was strong amid the support the market has been seeing from the Federal Reserve.But JPM shares were trading 1% lower in the premarket, perhaps a result of JPM having been on quite a tear, rising nearly 48% since the start of November.  JPM CEO Jamie Dimon may have contributed to this morning's general weakness, saying there is still "significant near-term economic uncertainty." Still, although the bank is keeping credit reserves of more than $30 billion, the fact that it was able to release some of the money it had set aside for loan losses seems good news for the broader economy as it continues to recover, and as it looks forward to more stimulus and wider-spread vaccines.Turning to the other big bank earnings news from this morning, Wells Fargo & Co's (NYSE: WFC) results were mixed, with the bank-beating expectations on its bottom line number but missing on revenue. Legacy issues continued to haunt it, and its CEO said its "results continued to be impacted by the unprecedented operating environment." Its shares were off 1.3% in pre-market trading.Meanwhile, Citigroup Inc's (NYSE: C) shares were also lower despite an earnings beat. The bank reported slightly lower-than-expected revenue. Last quarter, the banks boosted market sentiment regarding how investors and traders felt about the upcoming earnings season. This time around, it looks like the reaction isn't as optimistic. Still, we haven't yet seen all the results from the big banks.An upsurge in capital markets trading activity and a very strong initial public offering (IPO) market could bode well for Q3 outperformers Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS). However, the more consumer-oriented Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) might face continued challenges, according to analysts' sagging estimates for the company.Jobless Claims Uptick, But Reassurance From The Fed The main three U.S. indices were relatively muted yesterday as details about President-elect Joe Biden's stimulus plan came in, new data showed the jobs market has taken a turn for the worse, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated what investors expected to hear about interest rates and bond purchases.Powell delivered on what most in the market probably expected to hear--that the central bank isn't planning to raise interest rates or taper its bond purchases any time soon. Despite those tools being in use because of the adverse effects from the coronavirus on the economy, Powell also said the economy might be able to get back to pre-pandemic levels sooner than feared.Nevertheless, things don't look particularly great right now on the economic front. Data yesterday showed that weekly jobless claims rose to their highest level since August, spiking to 965,000 when a Briefing.com consensus had been expecting 780,00.Still, the market opened in positive territory, perhaps as some investors and traders figured the labor market situation might give lawmakers extra incentive to pass further stimulus. As the pandemic has dragged on, it's also possible that Wall Street has become a bit numb to the jobless numbers. It might be easy to forget that, even if the figure had come in at 780,000, as expected, that's still an astronomical number compared to where we were before the pandemic.Shots In The Arm: Stimulus And Vaccines Stimulus expectations seemed to buoy the market, before it ran out of steam toward the end of the session, on hopes that the stimulus measures will help tide the economy over until vaccines can be widely administered and help the economy get back on its feet. Speaking of vaccines, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) shares finished the day up 1.75% after early safety study data showed its coronavirus vaccine produces a promising immune response. While the vaccine still has a ways to go before it could be authorized for use in the broad population, the findings offer another arrow of good news in the quiver of humanity's attempts to beat back COVID-19.It seems that the market has plenty to be optimistic about despite the ongoing pandemic. That might be why big tech-related companies had a down day. All the FAANG stocks ended the day lower, helping pull down the broader market. These stocks have been in heavy demand during the pandemic as their size, cash and technology-focused businesses made them a safe haven investment of sorts while many other companies had a rougher time. Now, as the vaccine rollouts, stimulus efforts, and Fed backstopping help investors and traders become more optimistic, the big tech-related names have been giving way to stocks that stand to benefit when the economy gets back to normal. That dynamic was borne out yesterday as the Russell 2000 (RUT)-- which is made up of small cap domestic stocks that are expected to do better as the economic recovery continues--managed to increase its gains during the day, rising more than 2%, even as the three main U.S. indices pared their gains and ended up in negative territory.CHART OF THE DAY: The ICE U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY), which measures the buck against a basket of other major currencies, has been on the decline in recent months as Federal Reserve and Congressional efforts to boost the economy have diluted the value of the greenback. A lower buck tends to help U.S. multinationals. See more below. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Mark Your Calendar: Next week's economic calendar is relatively light, but that doesn't mean investors get a total break from the flow of important data. The weekly initial jobless claims report may bear even more scrutiny on Thursday, as investors try to discern whether unemployment claims in the 900,000 range might become a trend for a while after this week's figure. Market participants will also get to look a little deeper into the state of the housing market with reports on housing starts, building permits, and existing home sales. It could be interesting to see how low mortgage rates are affecting those numbers. Notable earnings reports next week include Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).Earnings Outlook Less Bad: Speaking of earnings, fourth quarter S&P 500 Index (SPX) earnings growth estimates have been increasing, with analysts raising their forecast to a 9.8% decline recently from a 14.4% drop in July as the economic recovery has been generally going better than expected, despite some pockets of entrenched weakness and recent data showing a moderation in economic activity because of the third COVID-19 wave, according to Zacks Investment Research. Although the quarter

There has not been an official decision on any launches, the financial news outlet reported.The prototype screen would make the iPhone bigger and "more pocketable." A person familiar with the testing told Bloomberg that screens would have "a mostly invisible hinge with the electronics stationed behind the display." Why It Matters: Apple has not announced any major changes for 2021 production yet, fresh off changes it made in 2020 for new designs, package conditions and 5G.But the Cupertino, California-based company is trying out one new feature: an in-screen fingerprint reader to unlock the smartphone.Under current conditions, where people have to wear masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making facial recognition difficult, this feature would be useful to iPhone users.Price Action: Apple shares fell 0.25% and closed at $126.82 in the post-market trading on Friday, after a $127.14 close in the regular hours trading.Image credit: Unsplash.comSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Parler No. 1 On App Store A Day After Apple Warns Of Removal(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

The cost of a home averaged 253,374 pounds ($340,000) in December, up 6% from a year ago, according to mortgage lender Halifax.That gravity-defying increase during the worst economic slump in three centuries has put ownership further out of reach for the young, particularly in London where the value of property has almost doubled in the last decade. It?s piling misery on a section of the population already hard hit by the pandemic, with young people more dependent on sectors closed by lockdown.?It?s about the imbalance of economic power,? said Robert Joyce, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and a participant in a review of inequalities led by Nobel Laureate Angus Deaton. ?More and more houses are owned by the same people, a narrow segment of society who are renting them out to younger people.?There are implications for the productivity of the economy too. High housing costs can make it hard for workers to relocate, depriving companies of talent and robbing young people of opportunities for better jobs and pay.The widening gulf between ?generation rent? and those just a decade or two older has spawned a range of housing initiatives since the financial crisis. More recently, it has fueled a debate over whether Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak should follow countries such as Argentina by levying a wealth tax to help repair Britain?s coronavirus-ravaged public finances.A vocal advocate of higher taxes on the rich is Gary Stevenson, an inequality economist and former Citibank trader who accurately predicted rock-bottom interest rates remaining for long after the financial crisis. He sees a similar scenario unfolding now and warns that London house prices could double again.?It makes social mobility completely impossible and housing completely inaccessible for the bottom 50 or 60 percent of society,? Stevenson said. ?It?s like cutting off the bottom half and saying, you guys lost capitalism, you?re out.?Affordability is particularly stretched in the U.K. capital, where first-time buyers paid 420,618 pounds on average at the end of 2020, the equivalent of more than nine times their earnings, according to Nationwide Building Society. It means buying often requires outsize deposits, or having money from family.While overall wealth inequality in the U.K. is far less pronounced than in the U.S., the gap has widened in the last decade. That reflects both Bank of England stimulus to fight the financial crisis, which fueled a surge in asset prices, and fiscal austerity that hit those of working age harder than older people.In 1996, more than half of 25-34-year-olds owned their homes, according to the IFS. By 2017, that figure had fallen to little more than a third.The pandemic has made the challenge facing the young harder still, with a record-low BOE benchmark rate and a temporary tax cut on homebuying feeding demand. Lenders meanwhile are withdrawing low deposit mortgages or increasing interest rates on them amid growing worries about risk.For years, build, build, build has been the mantra of campaigners, who say that new homes are the key to fix the housing crisis. But despite a homebuilding recovery in the past decade, Britain is still constructing half of the homes that it did at its peak in the late 1960s.In the year to March last year, the number of dwellings -- new builds, conversions and re-purposed property -- rose by under 250,000, leaving the government a way to go to meet its target of 300,000 a year by the middle of the decade. Some say close to 350,000 are needed.A key plank of the strategy is the provision of affordable homes. These rose just 1% and were almost 90,000 short of the 145,000 that the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says is needed each year for the next decade. Its head of policy, Will Jeffwitz, says that target won?t be met anytime soon.?It will mean that millions of people will be living in homes or continue to live in homes that are either unaffordable, insecure or of poor quality with knock-on effects on health, wellbeing and children?s ability to learn,? he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.
2021-01-17 02:59:07 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-17 02:59:07 and 2021-01-17 07:35:01+00:00: Shares of Wells Fargo fell 7.8% on Friday after the banking giant reported revenues of $17.93 billion that fell short of analysts? expectations of $18.13 billion. Moreover, the figure compared unfavorably to the year-ago period's revenues of $19.86 billion. Wells Fargo's (WFC) lower revenues reflect declines across all of its business segments. Meanwhile, the company?s earnings per share of $0.64 topped the Street's estimate of $0.60. The bottom-line result also marked a 6.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter?s earnings of $0.60 per share, reflecting lower noninterest expenses. (See WFC stock analysis on TipRanks). In response, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. Kotowski wrote, ?We think it was a solid quarter, in particular the "core" expense control showed signs of discipline. Asset quality trends were also stable. While NPAs (Non-Performing Assets) ticked up slightly from 0.89% in 3Q20 to 1.00%, NCOs (Net Charge Offs) trended down from 0.29% to 0.26% QoQ?a solid outcome in this environment.? Overall, the consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $34.17 implies upside potential of about 6.7% to current levels. Shares have plunged 33.7% in one year. However, TipRanks? Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in WFC is currently Very Negative as 34 hedge funds decreased their cumulative holdings in WFC by 40.8 million shares in the last quarter.

The bank's 4Q revenues of $16.5 billion declined 10% year-on-year and came in below analysts? expectations of $16.7 billion. The banking giant's weak top-line performance reflects a 14% decrease in its Global Consumer Banking division. The bank said that the lower interest rates and decline in card volumes weighed on the segment's revenues. Citigroup (C) reported earnings of $2.08 per share that exceeded the Street estimates of $1.34 per share, reflecting the lower cost of credit. However, its EPS declined 3% year-on-year due to weak revenues and higher operating expenses. Moreover, an increase in the effective tax rate further pressured its bottom line. Citigroup's total deposits increased 20% year-on-year to $1.3 trillion, while loans declined 3% to $676 billion. Meanwhile, its allowance for credit losses on loans stood at $25 billion. Citigroup?s CEO Michael Corbat said, ?We remain very well capitalized with robust liquidity to serve our clients. Our CET 1 [Common Equity Tier 1 Capital] ratio increased to 11.8%, well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our Tangible Book Value per share increased to $73.83, up 5% from a year ago.? (See C stock analysis on TipRanks) The bank also announced that it could resume share buybacks in the current quarter. Following the earnings release, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $111 (72.8% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said, ?Given the nature of the year we are having, a blip in expenses is not a major concern.? From the rest of the Street, the stock scores a bullish outlook with the analyst consensus of a Strong Buy based on 13 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $74.93 implies upside potential of about 16.7% to current levels. Shares have declined 18.4% in one year. Meanwhile, TipRanks? Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Citigroup is currently Very Positive, as 30 hedge funds increased their cumulative holdings in Citigroup by 7.2 million shares in the last quarter.

JPMorgan?s (JPM) 4Q net revenues increased 3.2% to $29.2 billion year-on-year and topped Street estimates of $28.65 billion. Further, its adjusted earnings of $3.07 per share came in ahead of the consensus forecast of $2.62. The bank's average loans were up 1%, while its deposits surged 35% during the quarter. Moreover, revenues from the Corporate & Investment Bank segment grew 17% year-on-year, reflecting 37% growth in investment banking revenues and an 18% increase in Markets & Securities Services sales. (See JPM stock analysis on TipRanks). Following the earnings release, RBC Capital analyst Gerard Cassidy raised the stock?s price target to $150 (8.2% upside potential) from $130 and reiterated a Buy rating. In a note to investors, Cassidy said that JPMorgan?s impressive performance was "led by better-than-anticipated revenues and a significant loan loss provision benefit (negative loan loss provision)." He added, "Assuming the economy continues to expand throughout 2021, JPM should steadily rebuild its earnings power along with the strengthening in the economy." Overall, the rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic on the stock, with the Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 10 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $145.86 implies upside potential of about 5.2% to current levels. Shares have gained about 1.4% over the past year.

However, lower revenues and a decline in net interest margin led to a 3.5% drop in its stock. PNC Financial?s (PNC) 4Q earnings of $3.26 per share grew 34.2% year-over-year and came in ahead of analysts? estimates of $2.54. Its 4Q revenue of $4.21 billion declined 2.6% from the year-ago period but exceeded the Street's $4.13 billion call. Average deposits grew 25% year-over-year, and the net interest margin stood at 2.32% as of Dec. 31, 2020, versus 2.78% as of Dec. 31, 2019. The decrease reflects lower loan yields. Provision recapture was $254 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a provision for credit losses of $221 million in the year-ago quarter. (See PNC stock analysis on TipRanks) Meanwhile, on Nov. 16, PNC agreed to acquire BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. from Spanish financial group BBVA S.A. for about $11.6 billion in cash. PNC Financial has sold its equity stake in BlackRock to finance the transaction. The deal, which is expected to close in mid-2021, will increase PNC's total assets by about $102 billion, making it the fifth-largest bank by assets. It will also expand the bank?s presence in 29 of the 30 largest US markets. Following the 4Q results, Raymond James analyst Michael Rose maintained a Hold rating on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said, ?Looking ahead, its outlook calls for flat revenue (+fee revenues, -NII) and noninterest expenses in 2021 on a standalone basis inclusive of $300 million of savings from its continuous improvement program (CIP). However, the potential for deposit growth and further steepening of the yield curve could drive PTPPI [pre-tax, pre-provision income] growth/positive operating leverage.? From the rest of the Street, the stock scores a cautiously optimistic outlook, with the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy based on 4 Buys and 11 Holds. The average analyst price target of $154.46 implies that shares are fully priced at current levels. Shares have gained 1.6% in the last year.

Bullish gas price forecasts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wood Mackenzie Ltd. indicate that the wild ride might not be over just yet.?It?s been a very exciting start to the year and there?s every chance that the next few weeks and months will be extremely volatile too,? said Bo Palmgren, chief operating officer at Danish trading company MFT Energy A/S in Aarhus.It?s a stark change from a year ago when the pandemic paralyzed industrial activity and even spurred talk of gas prices following oil below zero because of an unprecedented glut. An increase in the roll out of vaccines may also drive economic recovery and spur demand.A relatively rare weather phenomenon with the potential to disrupt the polar vortex -- the winds that usually keep cold air contained in the far north -- is threatening to send a further Arctic blast across North America, Europe and Asia from late January.Read more about the havoc the cold weather is causing around the worldPeople turning up their heating could increase the depletion rate at the region?s gas stores going into spring. The knock-on effect is that summer prices will be buoyed by the demand to fill depleted fields and salt caverns ahead of next winter.?The current cold spell in the northern hemisphere is paving way for a tighter global gas market throughout the year,? said Massimo Di Odoardo, director of European gas at WoodMac.Goldman on Wednesday raised its forecast for the Dutch month-ahead contract, the regional benchmark, by 19%. Woodmac expects the average price to be 75% higher than last year, it said on Thursday.European carbon prices traded at a record on Jan. 12. Fundamentals look more bullish this year than in 2020, Energy Aspects Ltd. said in a note. If the cold weather persists over the next month, power prices in Germany and the Nordic market could gain as much as 10% because of the hike in demand, said Arne Bergvik, chief analyst at Swedish utility Jamtkraft AB.Except for a balmy start to next week, temperatures in northwest Europe are mainly forecast below seasonal norms for the next month. That should support everything from gas to power and carbon futures, which all reached new highs last week. The region?s normally steady supply of liquefied natural gas cargoes could also sail away to Asia, where gains beat even the Bitcoin rally to new highs.The past week showed what the volatility is all about. An 18% jump on Tuesday in the benchmark contract was followed by the biggest plunge ever a day later. Prices moved at least 10% from the five-day average on 66 occasions over the last year, according to ICE Endex.While traders love that kind of volatility, it could also work as a deterrent for some new consumers, said Nikos Tsafos, a natural gas analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Despite the possibility for many more weeks of a demand-zapping lockdown in Germany, power prices in Europe?s biggest market are headed for the most expensive February since 2012. The Nordic market is even more bullish after prices jumped 39% this year. A smaller premium could potentially reduce the usual flows of power to the continent from the Nordic region.?We have a completely reversed situation at the start of 2021 compared with a year ago when the weather was mild and wet,? said Bergvik at Jamtkraft. ?If the cold and dry weather continues prices should go up.?(Updates with comment on carbon prices in the ninth paragraph.

(See GM stock analysis on TipRanks) Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky upgraded his rating on GM from Hold to Buy three days ago and set a price target of $56.

Capital One (COF) admitted that it had deliberately failed to implement and maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering program, with it also not reporting thousands of suspicious currency transactions. The violations are believed to have occurred from at least 2008 through 2014, and relate to Capital One?s Check Cashing Group. Capital One also acknowledged that it failed to report suspicious transactions by convicted money launderer, Domenick Pucillo, an associate of the Genovese organized crime family. Despite being informed about Pucillo?s association with criminal activity in 2013, Capital One continued to process over 20,000 transactions valued at approximately $160 million. FinCEN?s Director, Kenneth Blanco, called the violations ?egregious,? adding that Capital One?s behavior ?puts our nation and our people at risk? by depriving law enforcement of this information.

The company is armed with a huge patent portfolio, and offers several cutting-edge products in cybersecurity, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and automotive technology. What?s more, shares have surged 32% in the last two sessions after BlackBerry announced that it has sold 90 smartphone technology patents to Huawei, as part of its shift away from the mobile phone space. But while BlackBerry gushes with potential, it also disappoints quarter after quarter. In the most recent quarter, BlackBerry missed on revenue and GAAP EPS. Most concerning were the drop in revenue, down 20% year-over-year, and the sizeable increase in GAAP operating loss of $127 million, up from the $29 million loss one year ago. To be fair, some of the performance issues were pandemic-related, particularly with regards to the auto sector where plant shutdowns have translated to fewer automobile deliveries, and hence, lower QNX licensing fees. However, the company?s revenue has been shrinking for several years before the pandemic. The five-year growth rate for example is -20.8%. Company Transformation The story is not all bad. Glimmers of hope are emerging in what may yet shape up to be a multi-year turnaround story that started in 2013, the year that John Chen took the reigns of BlackBerry as CEO. At that time, BlackBerry was a $6 billion Titanic, immersed in red ink after hitting an iceberg called the Apple iPhone. After taking charge, John Chen proceeded to monetize the company?s patent portfolio, and transform the mobile phone manufacturer into a much more modest $1 billion software company. The transformation has taken place over several years, with half a dozen acquisitions along the way, including Cylance, Good, and AtHoc. These companies have been assimilated and worked into BlackBerry's product streams, but also have resulted in a significant write down of goodwill, including $500 million earlier in 2020. BlackBerry has at least stabilized its financial situation, and now has positive free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. That said, the turmoil surrounding the company has affected its stock price and resulted in an attractive valuation. BlackBerry also boasts some promising technologies that could lead to strong revenue growth down the road. This may be a great time to invest in BlackBerry. Valuation Metrics BlackBerry?s low valuation should come as no surprise given its past troubles. The company has superior metrics versus the software industry on a number of fronts, summarized in the table below. MetricBlackBerryIndustryPrice/Sales Ratio5.8511.31Price/Book Ratio3.0711.44Gross Margin74.2%70.9%Operating Margin-9.2%-23.6%Current Ratio2.271.57Total Debt/Equity0.330.55 Metrics such as price/sales and price/book ratio suggest that BlackBerry is quite undervalued, with a strong likelihood that the stock will outperform once the company?s future potential is recognized by the market. It is not at all unreasonable to expect a 2x - 3x stock price increase from its current level. BlackBerry IVY BlackBerry?s recent announcement regarding its strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services (AWS) may be enough to kick-start the company?s stock price. The exclusive partnership provides instant credibility along with a ?Big Data? mindset to vehicle data, resulting in unlimited potential for third-party applications in areas such as car insurance, maintenance, EV charging, and connected vehicles. The AWS platform gives BlackBerry IVY cloud-connectivity, scalability, and a global reach. This initiative will provide BlackBerry with a new source of recurring revenue in the automotive market, where it already has software installed in over 175 million cars. Spark Suite Apart from BlackBerry IVY, there are several other promising technologies emerging from BlackBerry, including Spark Suite, which combines Endpoint Management with Endpoint Security, a logical step in the evolution of mobile devices. Spark Suite provides Zero Trust, an emerging concept in cybersecurity that is becoming a necessity for enterprises as mobile devices such as wearables become the norm within the workplace. In addition to IVY and Spark Suite, BlackBerry has several other more mature product offerings including QNX, BlackBerry AtHoc, and BlackBerry SecuSUITE. While not as exciting as BlackBerry's recent initiatives, they provide a steady and increasing revenue stream. Wall Street?s Take From Wall Street analysts, BlackBerry earns a Hold analyst consensus based on 3 Hold ratings. Additionally, the average price target of $8 puts the downside potential at 18.7%. (See BlackBerry stock analysis on TipRanks) Summary and Conclusions BlackBerry has had a turbulent past, downsizing from a $6 billion hardware company into a $1 billion software company over the last seven years. Revenue was down 20% year-over-year in the latest quarter, but much of the poor performance can be attributed to the soft auto sector resulting from the pandemic. QNX licensing fees and royalties will pick up as the global economy improves. Despite several years of disappointing results, the company has stabilized its financial situation and appears to be positioned to capitalize on several leading-edge technology ventures, including its exclusive partnership with AWS and enterprise mobility management and security. Given the very low valuation, this could be an ideal time to invest in BlackBerry. Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

Answering Wallace's question about whether or not big tech is restricting speech, Cook said: "We have an App Store that has about 2 million apps in it. And we have terms of service for these apps. We obviously don't control what's on the internet, but we've never viewed that our platform should be a simple replication of the internet. We have certain rules and regulations, and we just ask that people abide by those."When asked whether there could be a balance between free speech and objectionable content, the chief executive said he doesn't believe there's a place for violence when it comes to free speech. "We looked at the incitement to violence that was on there, and we don't consider that free speech and incitement of violence has an intersection," he said.Apple took down Parler on Jan. 9, a day after sending a warning note to the platform's executives demanding they provide a moderation plan within 24 hours.Cook said the company is not banned but rather suspended, and could be allowed back. "If they get their moderation together, they would be back on there," Cook said during the interview.Cook and Wallace also discussed Apple's $100 million Racial Equity Initiative, which last week launched an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit.Why It Matters: Parler, viewed as a far-right social media platform, has come under fire since the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. It has been accused of failing to moderate discussions and plans of the attack. Google Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) removed Parler from its Android app store market on Jan. 8.Image: Screenshot of Fox News interviewSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Apple Tests Foldable Screen For iPhone: Bloomberg  * Parler No. 1 On App Store A Day After Apple Warns Of Removal(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been sued in California over allegations it failed to take action against messaging app Telegram in the aftermath of the Capitol Hill riot even as the platform was used to promote violence.What Happened: The Coalition for a Safer Web,  a Washington D.C.-based non-profit organization, filed the lawsuit against Apple in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Sunday.The group alleges that "Telegram is being used to intimidate, threaten, and coerce members of the public," and Apple -- despite reportedly having this knowledge -- lets Telegram be available through the App Store on its devices.The lawsuit further alleges that not only was Telegram used to promote violence during the storming of Capitol Hill by outgoing President Donald Trump's supporters earlier this month, also "for years, anti-black and anti-Semitic groups have openly utilized Telegram with little or no content moderation by Telegram's management.""Apple has not taken any action against Telegram comparable to the action it has taken against Parler to compel Telegram to improve its content moderation policies." CSW claims.Why It Matters: Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, in a statement late Monday, thanked "everyone who reported public channels that crossed the line" in the recent weeks, without mentioning the lawsuit."Telegram welcomes peaceful debate and protest, but our Terms of Service explicitly prohibit distributing public calls to violence," Durov said. "In the last 7 years, we've consistently enforced this rule globally, from Belarus and Iran to Thailand and Hong Kong."Apple, alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) withdrew social media app Parler from their platforms over similar allegations of promoting violence during the Capitol Hill riot. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) too withdrew hosting support, effectively forcing Parler to go offline, at least temporarily.Telegram, alongside rival privacy-focused messaging app Signal, has seen a surge in downloads owing to Facebook Inc.'s (NASDAQ: FB) WhatsApp's new proposed privacy policy.Price Action: Apple shares closed 1.37% lower at $127.14 on Friday.Read Next: Elon Musk Sends Signal Downloads Soaring: What You Should Know About The AppSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Parler Finds Its Way Back Online ?

Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Apple has.Apple's Debt According to the Apple's most recent balance sheet as reported on October 30, 2020, total debt is at $112.44 billion, with $98.67 billion in long-term debt and $13.77 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $38.02 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $74.42 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Apple's $323.89 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.35. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Apple also posted a total of $64.70 billion in sales, a 8.4% increase since Q3. Apple earned $13.09 billion, and sales totaled $59.69 billion in Q3.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, Apple posted an ROCE of 0.23%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on AAPLROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Apple is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Apple, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q4 Earnings Recap Apple reported Q4 earnings per share at $0.73/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.7/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * A Look Into Apple's Debt  * 10 Information Technology Stocks With Unusual Options Alerts In Today's Session(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Following the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2021, an analyst at BofA Securities outlined the key emerging trends that could impact trading in semiconductor stocks.1\. Intel CEO Transition:  Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC) appointment of industry veteran Pat Gelsinger to enhance technical depth among the top rank is a welcome development, analyst Vivek Arya said in a note.Involvement of an activist investor, robust PC market, positive preannouncement for the fourth quarter and new 10nm product announcements at the CES, as well as the promise of 7nm improvements all led to the 16% year-to-date rally in the stock, the analyst added.However, the CEO transition is unlikely to reverse Intel's market share loss to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), non-CPU building blocks including accelerators and DPUs and alternative ARM-based internal chip designs from customers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the analyst said.Intel's manufacturing fixes, including partial outsourcing to Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), aren't likely to bear fruit before late 2022 or 2023, Arya said.Related Link: Why Applied Materials Is Needham's Top SemiCap Pick For 20212\. Taiwan Semiconductor Capex Boost:  The beneficiaries from Taiwan Semiconductor's surprising decision to boost capital spending by 50% are semiconductor capital equipment stocks such as Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT), KLA Corp (NASDAQ: KLAC), Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) and Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ: TER), Arya said.Semiconductor capital equipment stocks, the analyst said, will also benefit from Intel's desire to maintain its internal manufacturing, and the trend towards greater onshoring of semi production globally.3\. Auto Chip Shortage -- Short-Term Handicap, But Long-Term Positive:  With auto production expected to sharply rebound in 2021 and estimated to grow 10-15% on a year-over-year basis,  chip supply is found in shortage,  Arya said."L-t, capacity additions and dissipating COVID-19 headwinds should ease constraints, with EVs (~2% of mkt) and growing infotainment, safety, and ADAS apps driving auto semi growth well above SAAR for several years," the analyst wrote in the note.4\. SMID-cap, Semi Equipment Stocks In Favor:  The top five year-to-date gainers are Applied Materials, KLA, II-VI, Inc. (NASDAQ: IIVI) and Lam Research, Arya noted. This is due to rising rates that has led to near-term rotating investor flows out of higher PE, more "secular growth" stocks, he added.Photo: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * ViacomCBS To Launch Paramount+ Streaming Service March 4: What You Need To Know  * Lilly Awash In Catalysts, Pipeline Updates, Mizuho Says In Upgrade(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

But the U.S. Secret Service could be able to take necessary steps to safeguard the connected device from outside threats.Like clockwork, the media seems to love a story about a new security threat entering the White House. In 2016, security experts were concerned that outgoing President Donald Trump's Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone poses a threat. Similarly, former President Barack Obama didn't want to part ways with his BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE: BB) when he entered the White House.Related Link: Biden's Day One Executive Orders Agenda To Include Health, Equality, Climate Change, Halt Trump Legacy OrdersWhy It's Important: Security experts may be confident that Biden's Peloton bike poses a very small risk. But, CISO at Cyjax Ian Thornton-Trump told Forbes the job of the Secret Service and other security apparatus in the White House is to mitigate every single risk."IoT devices in proximity to, or used by, the President should come under the utmost scrutiny--as I think the key issue here may be covert audio or video surveillance when in use or when idle (and not powered off)," said Thornton-Trump.What's Next: Biden may be able to keep his bike but at the expense of removing the camera, microphone, and all access points to the internet.Peloton's stock traded up about 3.5% to $154 at publication time.(Photo: Peloton)See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * UBS On Internet Stocks: Chewy, Fiverr, Peleton Downgraded To Sell, Take-Two Interactive To Neutral(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Chopra also famously objected to a $5-billion settlement from Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) following a government probe into privacy missteps, claiming the fine imposed was not large enough.Related Link: Here's How Americans Are Spending Their Stimulus PaymentsIn addition to Chopra's appointment, Biden will also be nominating Gary Gensler to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler will be replacing Jay Clayton, who earned a reputation for being soft on Wall Street during his tenure as SEC head.Experts say Gensler will likely take a much more hands-on approach to banks, brokers and other public companies. Gensler enacted a new set of rules for swap trading at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during his tenure as chairman following the chaos that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis.He also oversaw the prosecution of several major investment banks during a Libor price-fixing scandal.Aggressive Stimulus: Finally, incoming Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will urge Congress to "act big" in providing economic stimulus to avoid a prolonged U.S. recession.Yellen pledged her support for Biden's recently unveiled $1.9-trillion coronavirus relief package as part of her confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday."Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big," Yellen said in a prepared statement.Benzinga's Take: The general consensus among economists and insiders seems to be that Biden's regulatory team is bad news for Wall Street. Trump made a point of appointing regulators that took a hands-off approach to oversight, but Biden seems to be going in the opposite direction by selecting regulators with reputations for being aggressive.The nominations of Chopra and Gensler could be bad news for big tech stocks and banks given the two men's histories of sticking up for consumers and investors.Big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) could be in for a tough four years ahead.Big bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) could also be on a short leash.At the same time, Gensler's appointment could be good news for cryptocurrencies and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC) given he recently taught MIT courses on blockchain and digital currencies.The market's positive open on Tuesday also suggests investors care more about Yellen's bullish stimulus comments than the potential harsh regulatory environment ahead.More stimulus spending in the near-term is good news for bank margins given the yield curve is steepening. Inflation concerns could be good news for the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD). Infrastructure spending could benefit construction material stocks like Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC). And finally, Biden has made his commitment to clean energy very clear, which could create significant tailwinds for funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ: ICLN).Janet Yellen, incoming President Joe Biden's nominee for treasury secretary.

Markets across the world surged on Wednesday, with the Dow gaining more than 258 points, the S&P 500 up 1.4% and the Nasdaq up nearly 2%.Former President Donald Trump was anti-immigration, pro-fossil fuel and hostile toward China, said CNBC "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer. In contrast, Biden is pro-immigration, against fossil fuels and much softer on China, he said. With a new administration in charge, the U.S. should see a change in the speed of the coronavirus vaccine rollout, the CNBC host said. The issue with vaccine rollout is that the federal government gave those involved in the distribution process the same amount of power in deciding what vaccines went where, Cramer said. "The problem is, when everyone is in charge, nobody is in charge." Here's what Jim Cramer says is ahead in 2021 with Biden in the White House:E-Commerce: The pandemic accelerated the growth of e-commerce, and consumers in 2021 will not slow down on ordering from the comfort of their home, Cramer said. Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) have only just begun, he said. Travel and Leisure: Once there is an effective vaccine distribution plan, travel will surge, helping companies like Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), cruise lines, airlines and companies like Boeing (NYSE: BA), the CNBC host said. Digitization and Cybersecurity: With more technological advancements to come in the cloud realm, Cramer said companies like Servicenow (NYSE: NOW), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and cybersecurity companies such as Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), will all be successful plays in 2021.5G: A massive worldwide shortage exists of semiconductors allowing for massive growth from chip makers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) as well as growth from cellphone service providers including T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS).COVID-19 Stimulus: With another round of stimulus payments expected to soon be in the hands of Americans, Cramer said retailers like Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ: COST), Amazon and Target (NYSE: TGT) could see upticks in their first-quarter earnings and continued growth through the year.China: In Cramer's view, Biden is soft on China and companies that are already established in the atmosphere there like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) will benefit.Wealth Management: Last year represented a surge for wealth and asset management companies such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Cramer said.Morgan Stanley was able to capitalize on a new generation of investors who believe that picking your own stocks is a "good way to manage your money," he said. Remote work: Even with the end of the pandemic on the horizon, remote work is here to stay, Cramer said. For the last 10 months, millions of white collar employees have worked from home, and eh said studies show that their productivity rose.Companies such as Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM), and Amazon will benefit from the creation of more elaborate home offices, he said. Health Care: Biden doesn't have the votes in Congress to change much in regards to health care, Cramer said, adding that an effort is likely to try to make health insurance cheaper for working class Americans, boosting companies like Centene (NYSE: CNC) and Humana (NYSE: HUM).Electric Vehicles: With the Democratic Party being strong on fighting climate change, Cramer said people will start to purchase more electric vehicles.Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the manufacturers merging with special acquisition companies will see unparalleled growth, he said.General Motors (NYSE: GM) could also see a strong growth year due to its investment in EV manufacturer Rivian, Cramer said. Housing: With Biden planning on extending policies allowing more freedom for undocumented immigrants, Cramer said millions of people could get credit to buy new homes, adding that homebuilders like Pulte Group (NYSE: PHM) will see increases in demand.

The Tim Cook-led company plans to launch the VR headset as early as 2022 and it will go head-to-head against Facebook Inc's (NASDAQ: FB) Oculus, Sony Corporation's (NYSE: SNE) PlayStation VR, and others, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.The glasses on the other hand are still several years away even though a launch in 2023 was previously planned, Bloomberg's sources revealed.The VR device is said to be expensive and would cost more than rival products. Apple may limit the sale to one headphone per store which by Bloomberg's calculations -- with nearly 500 stores -- would cap annual sales at just over 180,000 units.Why It Matters: The Cupertino, California-based company is planning to include its most powerful processors in the headset and the tested chips beat the performance of its M1 Mac silicon, noted Bloomberg.See Also: What To Know About Spaces And Apple's Continued AR/VR PushThe iPhone maker has reportedly developed an approach that would allow those with poor eyesight to insert custom prescription lenses into the VR device.In May, Apple acquired NextVR -- a virtual reality startup that provides content for AR and VR headsets, including those made by its rivals.Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) subsidiary Google sells an enterprise edition of its AR product Glass which it says are meant for "hands-free work."

This acronym is used by traders to refer to stocks of seven of the biggest tech companies in the world.The combined market capitalization of these stocks is about $7.9 trillion, which is roughly 25% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 companies. To put things in perspective, the combined  market cap  of these seven stocks is more than the GDP of Japan, Germany or India, which are the third, fourth and fifth largest economies of the world, respectively.The ConstituentsThe stocks in the FANGMAN group are:  * Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB)  * Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)  * Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX)  * Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  * Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)  * Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and  * NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)Buoying S&P 500 Performance:  2020 was a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to economic contraction worldwide due to disruptions to businesses and other activities. The stock market, given its forward-looking approach, weathered the setback and ended the year with gains.For instance, the  S&P 500 Index  ended 2020 at a record high and in the process generated a return of 16.2% for the year. The FANGMAN stocks played a big role int that as they outperformed the broader gauge:  * Facebook: 33%  * Amazon: 76.3%  * Netflix: 67.1%  * Alphabet: 30.9%  * Microsoft: 42.5%  * Apple: 82.3%  * Nvidia: 129.3%Related Link:  10 Things Apple Investors May Wish For In 2021 FANGMAN, A Predictor of Stock Market Moves?  Given the outsized weighting in different indices, it is logical to view FANGMAN stocks as a good predictor of which way the broader market is headed.FANGMAN Invariably Outperforms Market:  For those investors who are looking for above-market returns, or "high-alpha" stocks, FANGMAN could be the better bet. These stocks outperform the broader market, thanks to their transformational business models, high growth and financial might, among other things.FANGMAN In Bubble Territory? From the perspective of topline growth, earnings potential and prospects, it is evident that the lofty valuations are justified. Higher P/E multiples of some of these stocks imply investors are willing to pay a premium to partake in their growth.Investors see them as compelling, as they are most levered to the digital transformation that is picking up pace.But the stretched valuations of these stocks could conjure up fears of a deep correction.One of the biggest risks faced by these companies is regulatory scrutiny. Analysts see the changing of the guard at the White House as a slight negative for these high-flying names."To be blunt, it's a clear negative for Big Tech as ultimately with a Senate now likely controlled by Democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around FAANG names, with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table," Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a Jan. 6 note.That said, the analyst remains bullish on tech stocks for 2021, but sees the tech rally will be more tame until the Street gets a better sense of the legislative agenda under President Joe Biden.Related Link:  Why This Wedbush Analyst Expects A Year-End Tech Rally Photo by Daisy Anderson from PexelsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * The Week Ahead In Biotech (Jan 24-30): J&J, Lilly to Kickstart Big Pharma Earnings, Amgen FDA Decision and More  * 8 Intel Analysts On Q4 Report: Why Some See Difficult Years Ahead For Chipmaker(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

He noted that Apple peaked on September 2 and since then it has been flat, while the S&P 500 gained more than 7%. The stock dropped 25% in two weeks after the peak, and since then it has returned to its former high. In principle, this is a setup for a breakout to new highs, said Worth. He has also noticed a bullish wedge pattern and a cup-and-handle pattern on Apple's chart. Worth thinks the stock is going to $150.To make a bullish bet, Mike Khouw wants to buy the June $140 call for $13 and sell the March $155 call for $3. The total cost of the trade is $10 and the distance between two strikes is $15. The trade breaks even at $150.

Ltd (OTC: HNHPF) -- better known as Foxconn.Luxshare acquired two iPhone assembly plants from Taiwan's Wistron Corporation in 2020, which unnerved some Foxconn executives, as per Reuters.Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 1.6% higher at $139.07 on Friday and gained 0.93% in the after-hours session.Related Link: Apple Supplier Pegatron Prepares To Make iPhones In India With 0M InvestmentSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Apple VR Headset To Arrive In 2022 And At A Steep Price: Report  * Spotify Brings On Board Filmmaker Ava DuVernay With Exclusive Podcast Deal(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Wednesday brings the triple crown when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) all report after the close.Company reporting hits a crescendo this week and next, accompanied by a mountain of data. The cherry on top is Wednesday afternoon when all those big names step to the plate and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell takes the mic following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. It's a lot to digest, and investors could have their hands full keeping up. In the background and sometimes the foreground, Washington continues to compete for Wall Street's attention. Biden and company are making news every day, often with market implications. Last Friday's word from Capitol Hill didn't sound quite as bullish on the stimulus, which weighed on stocks as investors contemplated potentially seeing $1 trillion instead of $2 trillion injected into the economy. But it's still early on that front. It's also early to talk about this week's data calendar, since there's no important data today. As the week advances, however, we'll get plenty. Some key reports include consumer confidence, durable goods, and a first look at Q4 gross domestic product (GDP). Meanwhile, a measure of German business sentiment dropped today, and that appears to be helping the bond market a bit this morning. Volatility is also higher, but so are stock index futures. Usually, when bonds are up it's a warning sign. So the market is sending mixed pictures early on. Apple, Tesla, Lead The Week's Earnings Parade It's not hard to pick a few earnings that stand out amid all the coming attractions and may set the tone with what they say. AAPL and TSLA could make for an interesting Wednesday afternoon. Maybe call them the "split twins," since both were in the headlines last year for splitting shares. Everyone knows how TSLA stock has gone parabolic since then, but AAPL shares actually spent some time wandering in the desert after the split before picking up some momentum and recently powering to new all-time highs. Looking ahead to TSLA's Q4 earnings report and conference call after the close Wednesday, investors are likely going to want to hear more details about production, especially after CNBC reported a planned 18-day shutdown of Model S and Model X lines in California. This might suggest the company isn't seeing as high demand for those older lines as for newer models. With AAPL, focus is expected to be on the iPhone 12, which the company launched last fall. Analysts take different positions on how well AAPL did in Q4, with some saying it was good but not great and others saying the iPhone 12 launch was an amazing success likely to be reflected by earnings. We'll find out Wednesday, but investors seem to be thinking positive. Shares of AAPL are up nearly 3% in pre-market trading today. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is another mega-cap reporting this week. Focus, as always, could be on its Azure cloud product which has been growing like a weed over the last few years but still appears to be trailing Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) cloud offering. Holiday Xbox sales also could get a close look from investors. And then there's Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), which is also scheduled to report Wednesday afternoon. Analysts are expecting a continuation of the ad revenue growth pattern, but they may be listening extra closely for any comments on the potential regulatory winds that have been swirling in recent days.  Last week's Tech earnings from IBM Common Stock (NYSE: IBM) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) didn't really light the world on fire, so the market might be hoping for something warm and fuzzy out of Tech in coming days. Maybe Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) earnings seemed kind of ho-hum the last few years, but not any more. They'll have a major spotlight tomorrow morning and probably a bigger audience than usual for their conference call, with lots of people hanging on any new word about their Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial. The company's been talking about having results soon. Could tomorrow be the day? We'll wait and find out. Positive vaccine news pumped up the market last fall, so don't rule out a possible boost to major indices if JNJ's single-injection vaccine results impress. Adding everything up, about 20% of S&P 500 companies report this week. Some of the other big ones include AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and McDonald Corp's (NYSE: MCD), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), and 3M Co (NYSE: MMM).  There's so many company reports this week that some who'd normally get a lot of attention, like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX), might get lost in the haze. So far, earnings have been better than expected. Going into earnings season, analysts had expected about a 7% year-over-year drop. So far, with 13% of S&P 500 companies reporting, the actual drop has been 4.7%, according to FactSet. There's still a long way to go, but it looks like the trend seen over the last couple of years where earnings look better in reality than in Wall Street's initial vision might be continuing.Also, 86% of S&P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise and 82% have reported a positive revenue surprise, FactSet said. That's way above historic averages.Two-Way Tech Last week saw a split in the Tech group, especially Friday after old-school Tech behemoths IBM Common Stock (NYSE: IBM) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) reported. Both disappointed Wall Street, and their weakness spread across not only the sector but possibly to the entire market as stocks struggled to stay above the flat line to end the week.At the same time, more money seemed to flow toward mega-cap Tech companies like AAPL and MSFT. Rising along with those were Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) and salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM), whose cloud divisions look strong compared to what people heard from IBM on Friday. It's tough straits for IBM here. They made a big investment in cloud technology and it's not necessarily paying off the way some investors might have hoped. Meanwhile, chip makers forged new highs throughout last week and AAPL and MSFT continued to grind upward ahead of their respective earnings. These fresh all-time peaks can be a double-edged sword for investors as earnings approach. One thing to remember is that when a company reports earnings and its stock is at or near historic peaks, the pressure can really be on to meet or exceed expectations. A stock that's priced for perfection tends to do badly when perfection isn't achieved in an earnings report. That's a warning not just for shareholders of AAPL, which is scheduled to report Wednesday, but for a host of other companies reporting this week with their shares on a roll including D.R. Horton Inc (NYSE: DHI), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX), Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ: ILMN), Stryker Corporation (NYSE: SYK), and, of course, TSLA. Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) is also on the docket this week, its first earnings report since getting the 737 MAX back in the air. Shares of BA and the airlines continue to get dragged as U.S. passenger traffic slumped after a brief uptick around the holidays.The Fed meeting that starts tomorrow almost gets pushed to the background with all this earnings news swirling around. It's hard to imagine them saying much of anything different, though obviously we'll look for any observations on inflation.CHART OF THE DAY: PAYING A PREMIUM. Nothing's rallying quite like the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RUT--candlestick). It's now trading at around 1.37 times its 200-day moving average (blue line).

First and foremost, with U.S. indices to new all-time highs last week, companies reporting quarterly results this week should be closely watched. We have 120 S&P 500 companies reporting and a few tech names that could move markets; keep an eye on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), to name a few. Last week, the move up was largely led by the Nasdaq and tech strength after NFLX beat expectations; this week we're seeing somewhat of a mixed start, but it will be interesting to see if tech continues to shine bright.We also have some closely-watched economic data this week like Durable Goods, GDP, more housing data, weekly Jobless Claims, and the Personal Income and Spending data due out Friday will help provide further insight as to what's happening on the inflation front. Don't forget about the Fed meeting this week. Investors and traders will be paying close attention to the two-day meeting, which begins Tuesday. Wednesday afternoon we'll get their decision on rates and bond purchases, and the Q&A session with Fed Chair Jerome Powell will follow.Oftentimes the Fed meeting provides for some good market volatility. Keep an eye on the U.S. Dollar and U.S. Treasuries to see how they respond to the news (or lack of); the Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged and purchases as is. In terms of individual markets to watch, I think crude and copper will be key in the coming weeks to determine how the demand narrative is playing out. Last week the EIA reported the first build in inventories for the new year; if that becomes a trend, it would not be a good sign. As always, lots to stay on top of, and lots to keep an eye on this week that could move markets!Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Friday's Market Minute: Is Bitcoin At An Inflection Point?  * Thursday's Market Minute: Tech Stocks Take Off(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

On the Options AI platform, a trader can select the bullish consensus for spread trades to generate debit call spreads and credit put spreads around the move. Or, if a trader believes that the options market is overestimating the move, a trader can select a neutral view to sell to both the bulls and the bears and generate credit/income generating strategies such as an Iron Condor at the expected move - shown here:A closer look at some spread trades to the bullish consensus, compared to stock and a single call:And a closer look at the Iron Condor, with strikes set at the expected move:SummaryRemember, the above are just examples of the many ways a trader might express a view using option spreads. They are intended solely to demonstrate how the expected move can provide actionable insight to consider before making any trade, particularly into an uncertain event. Whether gut-checking your own expectations versus the options crowd, generating trade ideas from option market signals, or for more informed strike selection. That's why Options AI puts the expected move at the heart of its chart-based platform. Learn / Options AI has a couple of free tools as well as education on expected moves and spread trading. The concepts shown in Starbucks can apply to any stock and it is simply used here for illustrative purposes. Expected moves will change slightly into each company's earnings events so be sure to stay up to date via the earnings calendar.

2021-01-25 15:28:35 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-25 15:28:35 and 2021-01-25 17:13:44+00:00: The coronavirus outbreak severely disrupted the stock market and the economy in 2020. While most stocks took a pounding during the COVID-19 sell-off early in the year, many soared to new all-time highs during the market recovery later in 2020. In 2020, U.S. short sellers logged $345 billion in net in mark-to-market losses, according to S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky. A large portion of those losses came from a handful of heavily shorted stocks that crushed short sellers last year."The largest losses were in the Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology Sectors while there were minimal profits in the Energy, Real Estate, Financial and Utilities Sectors," Dusaniwsky said Thursday.Related Link: 10 Stocks That Earned Short Sellers The Most Profits In 2020Tesla The Biggest Short Killer: Dusaniwsky said electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) was by far the worst short in the market in 2020.Tesla short sellers lost more than $40.1 billion 2020, nearly six times the losses they endured betting against any other stock in the market.Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) was a distant second, with short sellers taking just a $6.7-billion mark-to-market loss on the year.Dusaniwsky said Tesla averaged about $17.8 billion in total short interest in 2020. Not only was Tesla a bad stock to bet against in 2020, it was the single best-performing S&P 500 stock of the year, gaining roughly 700%.Worst Shorts Of 2020 Here's a look at the 10 worst stocks to short in the market in 2020, sorted by net mark-to-market losses:  * Tesla, -$40.1 billion.  * Apple, -$6.7 billion.  * Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), -$5.7 billion.  * Pinduoduo Inc - ADR (NASDAQ: PDD), -$4.8 billion.  * Square Inc (NYSE: SQ), -$4.7 billion.  * Sea Ltd (NYSE: SE), -$4.2 billion.  * Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO), -$3.6 billion.  * Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), -$3.2 billion.  * Carvana Co (NYSE: CVNA), -$3.1 billion.  * Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO), -$2.9 billion.Benzinga's Take: The least profitable shorts are not necessarily the stocks that gained the most in 2020, but rather stocks that have big gains and also the largest amounts of short interest.These 10 stocks highlight the extreme risk involved in short selling, which has theoretical gains capped at 100% while theoretical losses are unlimited.Photo courtesy of Square.

It will also be a busy week, or more precisely a busy Tuesday, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with 3M Co (NYSE: MMM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), American Express (NYSE: AXP) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) joining Microsoft as fourth-quarter earnings season gets into full swing. Tuesday The chip saga continues with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) whose shares rose about 5% over the past week. Expectations are high due to its strong fourth quarter results and Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC) upside guidance that was issued last week. Wall Street expects earnings of $0.47 on revenue of $3.02 billion as it assumes the pandemic made a minimal disruption to its business with positive trends in the data center business and PC sales. AMD has steadily gained market share from Intel in both of these categories. Microsoft will also report after the close, with Wall Street expecting earnings of $1.64 per share on revenue of $40.18 billion. The trends of working and learning from home continue to intensify demands for Microsoft's offerings, as evidenced by the strong Q4 demand. But its biggest strength over the past year has been the commercial cloud business, and Wall Street remains strongly positive about the company's outlook for fiscal 2021 due to Azure's momentum as it's revenue was up 48% on a YoY basis in the previous quarter. This was, however, a slight deceleration from the 50% growth in Q4, and investors will want some evidence that both Azure and Microsoft's Teams that compete against Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) can continue fueling its revenues to new heights. Wednesday Apple will report after the close, and Wall Street expects earnings of $1.40 per share on revenue of $102.76 billion. The holiday quarter is always a big quarter for Apple and it needs to meet these high expectations, as last year's quarter saw earnings of $1.25 per share on revenue of $88.5 billion. This quarter will be all about sales of the iPhone 12. However, Apple is about more than the iPhone, as its services business now accounts for almost 22% of total revenue. Last quarter, its revenue surged to a new record of $14.5 billion. Facebook will also report after the close with Wall Street expecting earnings of $3.19 per share on revenue of $26.34 billion. Facebook shares had an impressive run over the past week, suggesting that the concerns over digital advertising due to the pandemic have vanished. The social media giant topped consensus earnings expectations in each of the past eleven quarters and has missed earnings estimates just once over the past half of a decade. Yet, over the past year, its shares have been underperforming due to fears of regulatory and political risk. But if it shows a strong surge in daily and monthly active users with upbeat revenue guidance, its stock should be just fine. Tesla will report for the first time since it became part of the S&P 500. Wall Street expects earnings of $1.00 per share on revenue of $10.32 billion. Tesla's shares are up 20% year to date and 99.9% since the company last reported earnings on October 21, confirming that it is not showing any signs of slowing down. Elon Musk's focus has been on executing the strategy that brought top and bottom-line improvements while delivering almost half a million vehicles in 2020. Now, the electric vehicle pioneer has to show it intends to keep pressing the gas pedal. This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

What Happened: The database contains information on 500 million Facebook users, a person advertising the service told Motherboard. The data is reportedly related to a vulnerability that the Mark Zuckerberg-led company fixed in August 2019. Vice tested the bot and found that initial results from the Telegram bot are redacted but they can be revealed by buying credits. Each credit is $20 and prices range up to $5,000 for 10,000 credits. Why It Matters: The bot apparently contains information on Facebook users from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and 15 other countries. Facebook had more than 2 billion users by 2019 worldwide. The bot can be utilized by even novice cybercriminals as it is easy to access or by hackers, which can misuse the information, as per Vice. This month Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone users were suddenly logged out of their Facebook accounts due to an outage caused by a ?configuration change,? as per USA Today. Price Action: Facebook shares closed nearly 1.3% higher at $278.01 on Monday and fell 0.53% in the after-hours session.

Analysts and experts are presenting a mixed picture. Blast From The Past: BTIG Head of Equity and Derivative Strategy Julian Emanuel said the present situation is reminiscent of the tech bubble crash in 2000, CNBC reported. ?We don?t see any signs yet, concrete signs, of a medium term trading top, but this type of volatility leads us to believe that similar to 1999 to 2000, you could get a 10% to 15% pullback at any time,? said Emanuel. Head Scratching Experts: Surging stocks of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc (NYSE: AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (NYSE: BBBY), and even those swept in the wave like Nordstrom, Inc (NYSE: JWN), are perplexing experts. See Also: Why AMC Shares Spiked 40% Today Scott Redler, a partner at the online financial media network T3live.com, said that the internet frenzy is targeting ?names that are most shorted, to create one last squeeze,? as per CNBC. ?There?s definitely some excessiveness out there right now, which has some professionals scratching their heads,? said Redler. David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors said, ?I would have bet my first-born male that GameStop would not be trading at the levels it?s trading at now,? Bloomberg reported. Gambling and Investing: Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba had a warning for retail investors on GameStop, according to Yahoo Finance. ?If you want to gamble, go to the casinos. This is not what the markets are for.? See also: 'Peak Stupidity': The End Of The GameStop Short Squeeze Trade? ?It blurs the line between gambling and investing,? said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments, according to Bloomberg. ?When you?re divorcing fundamentals from where stocks are trading, you can do that as long as you?re on the right side of the trade. But when the trends change, you have to get off fast,? said Taylor. Ignore The Sideshow: Former hedge fund manager and CNBC host Jim Cramer said while short squeezes are ?entertaining? they are not enough to bring down the market. ?This stuff is ultimately a sideshow, At the end of the day, I don?t think a Reddit forum can bring the house down,? said Cramer, CNBC reported separately. ?With the exception of a handful of gigantic tech plays, there isn?t a stock out there that?s big enough to bring down this market.? Cramer?s take comes ahead of the earnings release of titans such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) this week.

What?s happening to tech stocks? Surging, gaining...come again? Wasn't tech supposed to wither away and die thanks to be big bad Democrat boogeymen? Wasn?t the radical Biden tax agenda and regulatory framework supposed to send your favorite tech stocks plummeting? Wasn?t Biden?s tax plan supposed to take an estimated 5-10% off the earnings per share? For now, it seems like the market is putting more of its hopes into Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan and ignoring his tax and regulation plans. As Treasury Secretary and former Fed Chair Janet Yellen claimed, Biden's primary focus is aiding American families (i.e., stimulus, low-interest rates) and, for now, not raising taxes. But nothing is for sure with this stimulus. Republicans will resist it, and some moderate Democrats may do so as well. With Vice President Kamala Harris as the only tiebreaker for a Democrat majority in the Senate, Biden needs all the support he can get to pass this aggressive stimulus. I maintain my view that the market is too complacent, and that we are about to enter a correction at some point in the short-term. It still reminds me of the Q4 2018 pullback. For one, valuations are absurd. Tech IPOs are a circus, the S&P 500 is at or near its most-expensive level in recent history on most measures, and the Russell 2000 has never traded this high above its 200-day moving average. While stimulus could be useful for stocks in the short-term, it could almost certainly mean the return of inflation too by mid-year. The worst part about it? The Fed will likely let it run hot. With debt rising and consumer spending expected to increase as vaccines are rolled out to the masses, the Fed is undoubtedly more likely to let inflation rise than letting interest rates rise. Others, however, believe that the market reflects optimism that the global economy will recover with the eventual lifting of COVID-related restrictions and more widely-available vaccines. John Studzinski , vice chairman of Pimco, believes that market valuations are strong and reflect expectations of this eventual reopening and economic recovery by the second half of the year. All of this simply tells me that the market remains a pay-per-view fight between good news and bad news. We may trade sideways this quarter- that would not shock me in the least. But I think we are long overdue for a correction since we haven?t seen one since last March. Corrections are healthy for markets and more common than most realize. Only twice in the last 38 years have we had years WITHOUT a correction (1995 and 2017). A correction could also be an excellent buying opportunity for what should be a great second half of the year. Therefore, to sum it up: While there is long-term optimism, there are short-term concerns. A short-term correction between now and Q1 2021 is possible. I don't think that a decline above ~20%, leading to a bear market will happen. In a report released last Tuesday, Jan. 19, Goldman Sachs shared the same sentiments. My goal for these updates is to educate you, give you ideas, and help you manage money like I did when I was pressing the buy and sell buttons for $600+ million in assets. I left that career to pursue one where I could help people who needed help, instead of the ultra-high net worth. Hopefully, you find my insights enlightening, and I welcome your thoughts and questions. We have a critical week ahead with the Fed set to have its first monetary policy meeting of the year and big earnings announcements on the horizon. Best of luck, have an excellent trading week, and have fun! We'll check back in with you all mid-week. Are We in a Tech Bubble or Not? Figure 1- Nasdaq Composite Index $COMP Some of the hottest performing tech stocks announce earnings this week such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) (yes I consider Tesla more of a tech stock than a car stock), and more. Pay very close attention. Although I am bullish on specific tech sectors such as cloud computing, e-commerce, and fintech for 2021, I?m concerned about the mania consuming tech stocks. Tech valuations, and especially the tech IPO market, terrify me. It reminds me a lot of the dot-com bubble 20-years ago. Remember, the dot-com bubble was a major crash in the Nasdaq after excessive speculation and IPOs sent any internet-related stock soaring. Between 1995-2000 the Nasdaq surged 400%. By October 2002, the Nasdaq declined by a whopping 78%. I have no other words to describe it besides the Nasdaq right now as a circus. Will the bubble pop now? That remains to be seen. But the similarities between now and 2000 are striking. I am sticking with the theme of using the RSI to judge how to call the Nasdaq. An overbought RSI does not automatically mean a trend reversal, but with the Nasdaq, this appears to have been a consistent pattern over the last few weeks. The Nasdaq pulled back on December 9 after exceeding an RSI of 70 and briefly pulled back again after passing 70 again around Christmas time. We also exceeded a 70 RSI just before the new year, and what happened on the first trading day of 2021? A decline of 1.47%. The last time I changed my Nasdaq call from a HOLD to a SELL on January 11 after the RSI exceeded 70, the Nasdaq declined again by 1.45%. The Nasdaq has an RSI of around 72 again, and I?m switching the call back to SELL. The Nasdaq is trading in a precise pattern and I am basing my calls on that pattern. I still love tech and am bullish for 2021. But I need to see the Nasdaq have a legitimate cooldown period and move closer to its 50-day moving average before considering it a BUY. For an ETF that attempts to directly correlate with the performance of the NASDAQ, the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ) is a good option.

What Happened It's also not surprising that some traders love leverage with technology exchange traded funds and in an expanding universe of such tactical instruments, an old friend should be on traders' radar screens this year: The Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL). Up nearly 16% over the past week, TECL attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the S&P 500 Technology Index. That makes TECL a leveraged proxy on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as those two tech titans combine for over 43% of that index. Why It's Important As a triple-leveraged play on a sector that isn't exactly docile, TECL shouldn't be held for more than a few days at a time. However, the environment is right for traders to move in and out of TECL over the course of 2021. ?If part of the thesis for further stock gains is massive central bank liquidity, tech should benefit from this trend, particularly if volatility continues to fall. Since 2008 tech has generally outperformed when financial conditions are improving. The average outperformance is approximately 30-35 basis points (bps) a month,? according to BlackRock. Another reason traders may want to embrace TECL this year is that the coronavirus pandemic, for its obvious negative consequences, is having some positive effects on tech. ?A good example of this is online shopping. Looking at domestic credit card data reveals an interesting pattern. As you would have expected, the share of spending going to online retailers spiked early in the pandemic, notes BlackRock. ?Less obvious was the staying power of this trend. Even as lockdowns eased, online retailer?s wallet share remained elevated relative to the pre-pandemic norm. In other words, even as consumer mobility returned, many households came to appreciate the convenience of services such as online grocery delivery.? What's Next Another catalyst for TECL is the robust consumer side of the tech story ? one that's a potential spark for many of the stocks in TECL's index, such as Apple. ?Household tech spending increased by more than $100 billion, or 25%, in the six months between May and November. While some of the end-of-year bump was a function of early holiday spending, the trend is clear and has been in place for some time,? notes BlackRock. ?For investors, all of this suggests pivoting within tech rather than abandoning the sector.?

If Apple beats, or even comes in slightly short, it would mark its first $100B quarter ? definitely a milestone. As the 5G smartphone cycle continues to kick off, Apple could continue to benefit, and we could see an all-around great year. The longer work-from-home continues as well, the longer Apple could benefit from increased demand for personal devices like iPads and Macs. Apple?s stock has been trending upwards since April, and the stock has just about doubled since the pandemic hit, making a new all-time high of $145.09 yesterday. Apple has also benefitted from its grouping with the tech mega-caps, FANGM, and saw gains after Netflix Inc?s (NASDAQ: NFLX) earnings report this week. Taken altogether, things are looking great. However, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) notes that most investors don?t expect Apple to guide for 2Q, and instead will take the upcoming report as evidence of Apple?s momentum for 2Q and beyond. Will the market get too excited and expect what Apple can?t deliver? Or will Apple keep climbing?

It?s a challenge, but a welcome one for many investors anxious to see how Q4 turned out for the major companies. The day begins with a fresh batch of earnings data but nothing new on the vaccine front. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) had really nice earnings and so did Raytheon Technologies Corp (NYSE: RTX). Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) wait in the wings for after the close. There?s so much to look at today it?s hard to keep track of everything. Some investors might have been hoping for a vaccine update from JNJ as part of its earnings today. Instead, the company promised results, ?soon.? With a lot of people worried about new virus variants and slower than expected ramp-up of vaccinations, any positive news on JNJ?s vaccine would probably be welcomed. Looks like we?ll have to wait a bit longer. We won?t have to wait much longer for the latest Fed observations. They start their meeting today and Chairman Jerome Powell takes the podium tomorrow afternoon. There?s not much drama here. It would be shocking if the Fed said anything other than what it?s been saying about keeping things dovish so the economy can recover. It is the Fed, so you have to pay attention, and of course consider listening for anything they say about possible inflation. Otherwise, it?s probably going to be like sitting through the same movie you just watched. Yesterday, ?risk-off? trading dominated. Bonds and volatility rose amid virus worries. Today, bonds stepped back just a bit, crude is holding steady, and markets in Europe rose overnight amid strong earnings over there. That, combined with the morning?s solid set of U.S. earnings reports, might explain the light pre-market gains for some of the major indices. Toilet Paper And Canned Stew On the first day of the biggest earnings week of the year, what rallied? Companies that make toilet paper, household cleaners, and canned beef stew. Kimberly Clark Corp (NYSE: KMB), Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX), and Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE: HRL) partied like it was 2020 on Monday. At the same time, big-Tech got some bids ahead of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) reporting later today and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) going tomorrow. Basically, the market behaved like everyone would be staying home a while longer, with investors once again embracing the stocks that rocked when lockdowns first hit. Meanwhile, the airlines that had found some buyers last week got sent back to the hangar, with American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL), and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) suffering sharp losses. At the same time, bonds also received some new love, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield down to 1.03% by the end of the day after it touched 1.19% earlier this month. Right now, yields might remind you of a turtle that stuck its head out from under its shell, sniffed the air, and then decided it was safer inside. The yield is at its lowest level since Jan. 6. All this could mean there?s trepidation about the pandemic, especially with Europe facing more trouble and new strains in the U.K. and South Africa. Carnival Corp (NYE:CCL) pushed back cruises. Also, the Biden administration?s decision yesterday to suspend travel to the U.S. from some countries helped reinforce that we?re far from being out of the woods. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) climbed above 24 for a while yesterday after dropping below 22 at times last week, a possible sign of investors fearing more choppiness in the coming days. The ?risk-off? mood might have gained strength by having 20% of the S&P 500 reporting this week and slow progress on vaccinations here. The market?s had an incredible run and many analysts worry things have gotten a little bit priced for perfection. There?s also concern that the Biden administration?s stimulus package might be pushed back on the calendar or trimmed, as it continues to face resistance in Congress. This could have been a factor pressing on some of the cyclical sectors yesterday like Financials and Energy, research firm Briefing.com noted. What Goes Up... Gamestop?s Wild Session Also, when you observe action like we saw in GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) yesterday, you start to scratch your head a little. The stock more than doubled at one point and trading had to be halted several times for volatility. Like it or not, this is the type of stuff that makes veteran investors think back to the crazy days of 1999 and 2000. GME is up another 14% in pre-market trading. It?s not too hard to find analysts who believe GME is trading far beyond its fundamentals, and there was talk that Monday?s move might have reflected a ?short squeeze.? Sometimes a short squeeze is followed by more buying, which was apparently the case last year with TSLA. It can also indicate lots of people with deep pockets not necessarily investing in a stock, but trading it. There?s nothing wrong with that, but if you?re a long-term investor it?s probably not a great idea to get too deeply involved in these moves. This is not normal activity, and you also have to be careful that when the music stops, so to speak?or when these buyers stop and it becomes like a game of musical chairs?that you?re not the one stuck without a chair and nowhere to turn to sell. The momentum that caused GME to go up can also be the momentum that causes it to go down, very quickly. Caution is the watchword, for GME and many other stocks that have been making new highs. Earnings could be the time when companies need to offer proof that their high prices are justified by the fundamentals. Looking ahead to this afternoon?s fundamentals, MSFT earnings could go a long way toward starting to tell the broader Tech story. Analysts expect the company?s commercial cloud segment to again be the main driver, with focus as always on Azure, MSFT?s main cloud platform. Azure sales grew 48% in the prior quarter, outrunning Wall Street?s estimates. We?ll see what sort of encore MSFT reports today. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) is a big company reporting after the close that almost gets lost in the shuffle with so many behemoths on the calendar this week. Investors can listen to the SBUX call to get a sense of how the company?s been dealing with various state lockdowns and reopenings. They might also get word on whether its huge international business, especially in China, has started to reflect the bigger economic growth seen there recently. Tomorrow morning get ready for some more big names, including Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) and Boeing Co (NYSE: BA). Boeing?s earnings will be the first for the company since the 737 MAX began flying again. Tomorrow afternoon is the big showdown as TSLA, AAPL, and FB all come to the table after the close. Also, tomorrow brings the close of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the latest economic observations from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. If you?re bored Wednesday afternoon, you can?t blame it on the market. One thing Monday?s quick early reversal from the opening rally might remind people of is how important it is to look at the warning signs when they flash. Bonds and volatility were both higher along with stocks at the start of yesterday?s session. When you see that combination, it often means stocks are on a leash. Consider keeping an eye on 25 for the VIX and 1% for the 10-year Treasury yield. Penetration above that on VIX or below that on yield could be another warning sign to bullish stock market investors. CHART OF THE DAY: BONDS SPOIL BANKS? PARTY. The bond market has been climbing recently, taking the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX?candlestick) down to nearly three-week lows. Falling yields can take the starch out of the Financial sector (IXM?purple line), and that?s what apparently happened over the last few days. Data Sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, CME Group.

For all of the relevant information, here is your guide for Wednesday's Q1 earnings announcement. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Apple reporting earnings of $1.41 per share on revenue of $103.28 billion. In the same quarter last year, Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99 on revenue of $91.82 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the "consensus estimates"; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an "earnings surprise", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on AAPL The Wall Street consensus estimate for earnings would represent a 71.74% decrease for the company. Sales would be have grown 12.48% from the same quarter last year. Apple's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 0.70 2.04 2.26 4.54 EPS Actual 0.73 2.58 2.55 4.99 Revenue Estimate 63.70 B 52.25 B 54.54 B 88.43 B Revenue Actual 64.70 B 59.69 B 58.31 B 91.82 B Stock Performance Shares of Apple were trading at $142.92 as of January 25. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 75.82%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders can be satisfied going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Apple is scheduled to hold the call at 17:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

A consensus sees Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) as joining that rarefied corporate crowd that?s broken the $100 billion in quarterly revenues mark when it opens the books Wednesday on its fiscal Q1. That?s a record for AAPL, of course, and may have been assisted by holiday sales of its new iPhone 12. But it?s one in a series of fresh peaks AAPL has scored in a year?one the company acknowledged was rocked by adversity in many corners. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the strong results in last quarter?s report were driven by ?the unmatched loyalty of our customers.? That may or not be true, but when AAPL reports earnings, investors also will be listening to how well AAPL is playing the market share game. The work-from-home trend, fueled by the pandemic, looks like it might have been a game-changer for AAPL, according to Morningstar analysts who believe it powered sales of iPads, desktops, and laptops. All that could be overshadowed in fiscal Q1 by iPhone 12 holiday sales, which it?s probably safe to say will get a fair share of attention Wednesday afternoon following the closing bell. AAPL has always been an attention-getter when earnings season rolls around, and now, with it sporting a $2.34 trillion market cap and reaching new stock price highs, it looks like it?s sure to take a spot under the limelight even when it?s up against a host of other high-profile tech stocks earnings results this week. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) report the same afternoon. The Numbers Wall Street analysts expect AAPL revenue to jump 12% year-over-year to about $103 billion, according to FactSet. But some firms, such as Loup Ventures, are looking for much stronger numbers: up 19% to $109.5 billion. From an earnings perspective, the Street has reached a consensus of $1.41 a share. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is also forecasting on the high side of consensus, eyeing revenues of $108.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.50. ?Our recent conversations suggest investors expect Apple to release solid, but not great, December quarter results,? Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent report. ?We disagree and believe that Apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings. ?In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple?s most successful product launch in the last five years,? they said. More on that later. Any way you look at it, the numbers look robust. The Innovation Machine AAPL stopped giving guidance last year?kind of like many other companies uncertain of the ramifications of COVID-19 on their sales. In March, no one knew what the ricochet effects of the pandemic might be or how long it might last. We still don?t know all of that, but we have found that the city- and state-mandated quarantines and the overall fear of being in public helped fast-forward many trends that were already picking up steam. The digital transformation sped up, and it looks like AAPL might have been well-positioned for it. While the iPhone 12 might get most of the attention Wednesday, think back to last quarter when CEO Tim Cook noted all-time records for Mac and Services. Though he didn?t offer guidance for this past quarter per se, he did suggest double-digit gains on all product categories except the iPhone 12, which he thought would reach single-digit gains. FIGURE 1: APPLE LEAVES INDEX IN THE DUST. Over the last year, shares of Apple (AAPL?candlestick) have easily outpaced the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX?purple line). Apple shares got off to a quick start in 2021, with investors apparently enthusiastic about tomorrow?s Q1 earnings prospects. Data source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Mighty iPhone 5G Launch Despite all the happy talk about fiscal Q4 revenues, iPhone?s weaker-than-expected sales offset the glee and pulled shares down nearly 6% in the first couple of days after the October earnings release. They have since recovered. AAPL reported iPhone sales of $26.4 billion in fiscal Q4, below the $27.73 billion expected by the Street. Much of that shortfall was attributed to AAPL?s decision to push the iPhone 12 launch into this most recent quarter, a move many believe may have led to consumers waiting for the upgrade before they bought. Back then, some analysts said a move to 5G could end up being a tailwind for the iPhone 12 with sales promotions and subscription services bundles. That, combined with the important holiday shopping season about to begin, could have led to a fast start for the new phone. We?ll see now if they were right. Analysts are mostly bullish on their iPhone sales expectations, with some saying the delay might have pushed around $4 billion in iPhone sales to the December quarter from the fiscal Q3. The Street?s consensus last stood at $59.58 billion, up better than 6% on a year-over-year basis. But Loup Ventures thinks that?s conservative. It?s looking for sales to vault 16% on a year-over-year basis to $64.9 billion, jumping to 59% of total sales compared with the iPhone?s typical 50% of sales standing. It?s unclear if that will actually be the case, but if it is it would reverse a trend in recent years toward iPhones being less of AAPL?s total revenue. The company has been emphasizing growth in services. Remember, we?re just two years out from January 2019 when Cook sent a letter to AAPL investors warning of a fiscal Q1 earnings shortfall due in part to weak iPhone sales in China. How things have changed. AAPL Earnings And Options Activity AAPL is expected to report an adjusted EPS of $1.41, up from $1.25 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $103.01 billion, up 16.4% from a year ago. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 6.2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move? indicator on the thinkorswim? platform. Looking at the Jan. 29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 125 and 135 strikes. But it?s been dwarfed by activity to the upside, heavy call volume at the 145 and 150 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 34th percentile as of Tuesday morning. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Home Work And Its Tools The work- and study-from-home phenomenon helped drive sales of Macs and iPads last year, and analysts widely expect that trend continued into the fiscal Q1. A number of bells and whistles were added to new iPads and iPad Airs, and new computers with AAPL?s custom M1 chip replacing the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) chip also hit the market. AAPL also is reportedly working on a new iPad Pro expected to be released in mid-March. There?s also talk on Wall Street that AAPL might have patented a new version of the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Given Cook?s comments about the ?most prolific product introduction period,? analysts widely expect to hear about other new products coming on line. An update of the MacBook Air is one of those possible developments. AAPL is working on a thinner and lighter version of the MacBook Air, Bloomberg reported late last week, citing ?people with knowledge of the matter. Analysts said they want to know if the planned release in the second half of this year is on track. Analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. expect AAPL to shed light on several new products and services, including how sales are going for its $549 AirPods Max over-the-ear headphones and the subscription Apple Fitness+ offering, plus ways to bundle services together for a discount. ?In our view, Apple?s portfolio was positioned better-than-ever heading into the recent holiday season, while product and service updat

What Happened: In line with Europe's quest to increase the share of green energy vehicles, the European Commission has earmarked 2.9 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of government funding for battery projects in the region, Bloomberg reported. This funding will be disbursed to about 42 companies, including Tesla, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (OTC: BAMXF) and Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA), the report said. Related Link: Tesla To Source Nickel-Heavy NCMA Batteries From LG Chem Starting In 2021: Report The government funding, according to the report, will trigger more than three times financing from private parties, taking the total funding available to more than $11 billion. Why It's Important: Tesla is constructing its Giga 4 in Berlin, which houses a dedicated facility to manufacture its self-developed 4680 battery. The EU financing should come in handy for meeting the capital needs of the project, and in turn reduce its reliance on outside suppliers. At last check, Tesla shares were gaining 0.91% to $888.78.

The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on ensuring small businesses receive the support they need to keep their doors open and continue to employ millions of Americans across the country. The Administration is working with the Agency to identify immediate solutions to address eligibility, compliance, integrity, and promote transparency. While reviewing the initial draw of PPP loans, anomalies ? mostly data mismatches and eligibility concerns ? were identified in approximately 4.7% of the lender-submitted data. These concerns will require follow-up between the lender and the borrower so that borrowers can access a second round of loans. The SBA is committed to working with lenders and eligible borrowers to provide the necessary information for follow-up and help get small businesses back on track so that they?re able to receive another round of PPP loans swiftly. The SBA encourages borrowers and lenders to work together as quickly as possible to resolve the issues. The SBA will automatically move favorable decisions to approval. During the newest round of PPP, the SBA has already approved over 400,000 loans for approximately $35 billion. ?Prior to this newest PPP round, the SBA supported 5.2 million PPP loan borrowers, providing more than $525 billion in economic relief to small businesses and other eligible entities. The Agency is committed to making sure compliance checks are executed on the front-end. The SBA is also committed to addressing issues more efficiently moving forward, to ensure fair and equitable access to small businesses in every community,? said SBA Acting Administrator Tami Perriello. The SBA is immediately addressing the PPP loan review to allow for Second Draw PPP loan applications to be processed in an efficient manner by: Hosting a national call to brief lenders on the Platform?s additional detailed information that will assist in the resolution of First Draw PPP loan review and potential holds that impact Second Draw PPP loan application approvalsEquipping the Agency?s field team of lender relations specialists with information so they can provide support to lenders and borrowers in understanding the issues and facilitating the appropriate responses to resolveProviding additional guidance to PPP lenders on the review and resolution process Through SBA?s 68 district offices, the Agency will work in close partnership with the Administration to further leverage its resource partner network and expand on multilingual access and outreach about the PPP. Updated PPP information, including forms, guidance, and resources is at www.sba.gov/ppp and www.treasury.gov/cares. ### About the U.S. Small Business Administration The U.S. Small Business Administration makes the American dream of business ownership a reality. As the only go-to resource and voice for small businesses backed by the strength of the federal government, the SBA empowers entrepreneurs and small business owners with the resources and support they need to start, grow or expand their businesses, or recover from a declared disaster.

The Phoenix-based miner now expects copper sales of 3.8 billion pounds for 2021, down from an October projection of 3.85 billion, while its annual gold sales forecast was pared 7.1% to 1.3 million ounces.Chief Financial Officer Kathleen Quirk described the guidance changes in Tuesday?s earnings call as ?minor revisions? to reflect costs tied to energy, currency and maintenance as the world?s largest publicly traded copper company ramps up operations at its flagship Grasberg mine in Indonesia.Shares of Freeport fell 7% at 12:52 p.m. trading in New York.Copper has been soaring since plunging early last year with Chinese and U.S. demand increasing as Covid-19 vaccines are distributed and economies recover, while gold climbed to a record in August. That helped propel Freeport?s earnings in the fourth quarter, with the miner posting net income of $708 million and adjusted per-share earnings of 39 cents to beat the 37-cent average estimate of 17 analysts. Revenue climbed to $4.5 billion, also beating estimates.?Strong Quarter??In our opinion, this was a strong quarter from an operational standpoint, with the company outperforming our expectations on both volume and costs,? B. Riley Securities analyst Lucas Pipes said Tuesday in a note to clients.Freeport said it expects unit net cash costs for copper to be $1.25 per pound, higher than its previous projection for less than $1.20, according to Tuesday?s earnings statement. The company projected in October that costs will decline as it ramps up production at Grasberg and a new operation in Arizona. Freeport also restarted its Chino mine in New Mexico this month at about 50% capacity, after suspending the operations last April due to Covid-19.Still, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said during the earnings call that past efforts will enable the company to increase margins and cash flows ?substantially? for 2021 and beyond.?Copper sales are projected to increase 20% over 2020, gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%. Our unit net cash costs of production will decline,? he said. ?This is occurring at a time for improved pricing for copper.?Higher CopperAdkerson sees copper going ?much higher? than $3.50 a pound, though even at that price Freeport is ?on the path? to nearly double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, from last year?s levels, he said.?The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business, return substantial cashflows to shareholders,? he said.Adkerson also reiterated interest in reviving Freeport?s dividend, which it suspended in March to help weather the pandemic.?Management expects to recommend to the board of directors the resumption of common stock dividends during 2021 and anticipates an ongoing ability to increase cash returns to shareholders in the future,? the company said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Levon Movsessian The Business of Blockchain and Bitcoin Toronto, Ontario, Jan. 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emerging technologies regularly serve as enabling forces for economic, social, and business transformation. This is why Bitcoin and Blockchain are on the rise. Blockchain is the underlying distributed ledger technology that allows cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, to work. All transactions that are written in blocks are immutable, and information can never be altered or removed. The nature of the technology makes it highly secure in theory, and it can be used for carrying out real-time, verifiable transactions between two parties. When Blockchain was in its infancy, few prospective users saw its potential. As the years passed, excitement regarding the technology?s future steadily grew since it was first conceptualized in 2008 by a pseudonymous person, or persons, Satoshi Nakamoto. Now, the Blockchain space is filled with amazing individuals. People like Levon Movsessian, a Blockchain consultant, real estate expert and entrepreneur, are more than willing to advance the technology to new heights and to leave their mark in the Blockchain industry as an early adopter. Levon started his entrepreneurial journey at the age of 20 in the real estate market. He was simultaneously pairing his love for animals with his philanthropic efforts ? working with multiple animal charities to raise money for global rescues and foundations while expanding his network. Then, in late 2013, he heard the buzz around Blockchain and cryptocurrency. After attending group events discussing Blockchain and the future of Bitcoin, his knowledge expanded by speaking with coders and professionals developing this technology. The concept was a marvel ? giving people more control over their finances, and freedom to take it wherever they go. Seeing the technology?s importance, he began teaching himself everything about Blockchain and became a pioneer for the industry in his early twenties. After solidifying himself as an expert, he built a Blockchain school to assist people in what they needed to know. He eventually decided to close down the school to focus his efforts on other aspects of Blockchain. Moving on from the education sector, he decided to consult and promote Blockchains for companies. He founded Quantum Block in 2017 to continue developing Blockchain and garnered more knowledge on the technology. He knew when he closed his school that people still needed access to this information, knowing fully well that the information available was complex and inaccessible for many. Knowing there had to be a better way to share this information, he took to Instagram, TikTok, and his own podcast to spread his knowledge about Blockchain technology and Bitcoin ? sharing informational videos about the market and how to protect your assets. Levon amassed much attention and acclaim for his knowledge and wants to show others that they can become successful in the cryptocurrency market if given the right education. Pushing the envelope on how cryptocurrency is used in our current markets, Levon made a statement to the world by being the first to purchase a Rolls Royce using Bitcoins in 2017. This milestone, while impressive, isn?t singular ? the potential of cryptocurrency promises financial success to anyone who possesses it. In the past three months alone, Bitcoin has gone up in value from $11,000 USD per Bitcoin to $40,000 USD per Bitcoin. As it?s becoming more widely used and recognized, Bitcoin and Blockchain technology will make fiat currency and data storing a thing of the past. Levon didn?t know at the time how much it would impact his life and the world. But with the connections he made and the knowledge he claimed, Levon Movsessian pioneered a movement that would affect the world?s trajectory. It is clear that Levon Movsessian is an authority figure in the world of cryptocurrency, and it will be interesting to see what his next moves are in 2021.

Foresight Research has been measuring marketing communications for over a decade, and in the past three years, of all the communications channel levers that an auto manufacturer can pull, public relations is almost tied with TV and closely follows digital. So, to back this statement up, a few facts are presented. Every year Foresight Research interviews over 5,000 new car and truck buyers. Respondents are asked a lot of questions, but one is what marketing communications channel influenced them to buy their vehicle. Public relations clocks in at 24% year, after year, after year. Digital and TV advertising is a little more - but just a little more. For the most recent model year (2019), PR closed the gap further as PR influenced 28% of all buyers, while TV stayed constant. Given that typical PR budgets are a generally just a fraction of the advertising budget - but the results are similar ? automotive PR is a ?best buy?. Drilling down on the PR effort to present more evidence of the PR value ? a few more facts are presented. 38% of all buyers say that they remember seeing an article about the vehicle they bought. Another 12% recall seeing a digital ?buff book? article. And 28% say they were influenced to purchase by their exposure to public relations. Of course, they also used other forms of communications: brochures, digital, TV, print ads and experiential events and auto shows. But PR is right up there. In addition to that, buyers influenced by PR are also more often influenced by the other forms of communication. So, when you put it all together, there actually is synergism. For 2020, a new report is now available from Foresight Research that does a deep dive into the power of automotive public relations. Foresight Research has interviewed over 5,000 new car and truck buyers to measure a lot of things to explain why PR is so valuable. Visit the website, e mail or call for more information and a webinar for you and your team. This very affordable syndicated report is now available. About Foresight Research ? www.foresightresearch.comSince 1998, Foresight Research has been providing consumer insights and data to support strategies and best practices for the automotive industry.

(NYSE: BLK), released his annual letter to CEOss Tuesday, with a focus on climate change. "We expect companies to disclose a plan for their business model will be compatible with a net zero [carbon footprint] economy," Fink said. With nearly $9 trillion under management by BlackRock, Larry Fink said that if a company wants to be the most profitable in its industry, it needs to move forward with ESG strategies and move more money into the space. If a company wants to have a high performing stock over an extended period of time, it needs to update its ESG strategies and move more into renewable sources of energy. Over the last year, billions of dollars has been moved into the space, with companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) leading the charge. "I believe that as long as money keeps moving into the space we will not see a bubble, a few companies might have a bubble ... we need to invest upwards of $50 trillion in order to see real changes." BlackRock has already committed to a carbon-free business model and highly urges the CEOs of all major companies to steer their companies in the same direction, he said.

The company also reported the departure of a key executive.Global same-store sales, a key gauge of restaurant success, fell 5% in the fiscal first quarter. That?s worse than the estimated decline of 4.2% compiled by Consensus Metrix. A 5% drop in the U.S. was just ahead of estimates, while a 5% gain in China beat expectations.The results show the company is facing an uneven road back following the deep impact of the global pandemic. Despite the continued weakness in many markets, same-store sales across the board are not as weak as in the previous quarter, suggesting it?s past the worst.Starbucks sees things turning around quickly from here. In the second quarter, which already started, U.S. same-store sales will grow 5% to 10%, it said. Comparable sales in China will nearly double, the company said, though the comparison with the height of the pandemic there will skew the result.The company reported fewer transactions overall, but customers spent higher amounts, continuing a trend established earlier in the pandemic. Revenue fell 5% from the prior year due to the impact of Covid-19, Starbucks said.The U.S. and China are the company?s two largest markets, together making up 61% of its global portfolio, with 15,340 and 4,863 stores, respectively, it said. Starbucks opened 278 net new stores in the quarter.Starbucks announced alongside its earnings release that Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer is leaving the company at the end of February to serve as chief executive officer at another publicly traded company. It said her responsibilities are being distributed to other members of the leadership team. Brewer, a former executive with Walmart Inc. and a current director of Amazon.com Inc., joined Starbucks in 2017 and is among the most prominent Black female executives in Corporate America. The news of Brewer?s departure comes just weeks after Starbucks announced its top finance officer will retire after a little more than two years in the role.Starbucks shares fell as much as 3.2% in late trading before paring much of the decline.(Updates to include departure of COO and adds company projections for second quarter.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

2021-01-26 16:45:17 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-26 16:45:17 and 2021-01-26 18:25:18+00:00: Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel. Even if one had a company?s earnings report ahead of the release, it still may be hard to predict the price action of the issue in the upcoming session. With that being said, General Electric (NYSE: GE) is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of the Day. Underperformer In 2020: After ending 2019 at $11.26, GE followed the S&P 500 index higher, reaching $13.26 in February before retreating to end the month at $10.88. It cratered with the broad market in March, falling to $5.90, and attempted to rebound. Whereas the index bottomed in March, GE undercut its Mach low by declining to $5.49 in May. That low coincided almost to the penny with its March 2009 low of $5.51. The index sharply rebounded from its March low to end the year with a 15% gain, while GE ended the year slightly in the red ($11.18 versus $10.80). It should be noted that a vast majority of the gains off the low came in November ($7.42 to $10.18). Off To A Good Start In 2021: The issue has moved in sync with the index in 2021. Both bottomed on the first trading day of the year, which for GE was $10.40, and began to rally. At the time of the writing of this article, the S&P 500 index is higher by 2.7%, with GE being higher by nearly 5.5% ($10.80 vs, $11.40). Wall Street Cautious Ahead Of Earnings: GE ended Monday?s session ($10.99) well off its yearly high from Jan. 12 ($11.91), which was the same day of its closing high price for the year ($11.78). In fact, in Monday?s sell-off it matched its year-end price ($10.80) when bottomed at $10.77. View more earnings on GE Mixed Q4 Report: Before the open, the company announced a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report. While beating on the top line for sales ($21.93 billion versus the $21.83 billion estimate), the company missed on the bottom line by a penny. The bright spot in the report was power orders of $5.6 billion, which was up 26%. PreMarket Prep Take On PreMarket Price Action: Off the print, investors choose to emphasize the sales beat. The issue immediately began to rally in almost a straight-up manner. Ahead of the opening bell, the issue peaked at $12.15 and managed to open just above the yearly high ($11.91) and $12 psychological resistance level. When the issue was being discussed it was trading actively at the $12 area. Investors were cautioned that if the issue opened above $12 and was unable to sustain that level, the issue may surrender some of its gains. The full discussion on the issue from today?s show can be found here: Price Action During The Regular Session: GE buyers were able to satisfy all the sellers in the lower $12 area and the stock was able to breach the premarket high ($12.15), reaching $12.23, and then sharply reversed course. It continued to make new lows for the session, with the current being $11.25 as of 1 p.m. ET.

About EVgo: Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corp (NYSE: CLII) is bringing EVgo public in a deal that values the company at $2.1 billion. EVgo has over 800 locations for its fast-charging stations in 34 states, including 67 major metropolitan markets. The company has supported over 220,000 customers. EVgo has the largest public DCFC (direct current fast charging) network. The company is a partner with General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Nissan, Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT) and Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER). Charging stations are hosted at retail locations like Albertsons, Wawa and Kroger (NYSE: KR). DCFC is the key that sets EVgo apart from competitors. DCFC made up only 5% of the market in 2019 and is expected to grow share to 40% by 2040. EvGo has 818 DCFC sites and 1,412 charging units. Related Link: 7 Current And Former SPACs That Could Be 2020 Election Plays Competitors: EVgo is the only charging partner engaged by multiple OEMs to build out the network. A deal with General Motors will see the company add over 2,700 additional fast-charging locations. EVgo also has a deal with Nissan that gives $250 charging credits to customers. The company is also the first charging network with integrated Tesla connectors. Going forward, over 770 connectors are being added to chargers to help Tesla customers. In the electric vehicle charging market, EVgo competes with Blink Charging (NASDAQ: BLNK), Electrify America, which is owned by Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) and ChargePoint, which is merging with SPAC Switchback Energy Acquisition Corp (NYSE: SBE). EVBox Group, which is going public with SPAC TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp (NYSE: TPGY), could also soon be a competitor as it seeks to enter the U.S. market. ChargePoint and EVBox both have hundreds of thousands of charging stations. EVgo is the leader in DCFC trailing only Tesla by the number of locations with fast charging stations. Chargepoint had 731 locations as of June, Electrify America had 438 and Blink was part of a combined group that had 140 DCFC. One notable difference between the competitors is an area of concern for EVgo. Despite its lead in the number of DCFC locations, EVgo has less connections than rivals due to an average of 1.7 per location. EVgo?s total of 1,338 ranked behind Electrify America?s 1,807 and ChargePoint?s 1,614. The industry average was 3.8 connections per charging location. EVgo is working on expanding the number of connections per location in the future with future spots having four, six or eight charging connectors. EVgo also prides itself in a 98% uptime rating. Customer satisfaction scores reflect the uptime with EVgo scoring an 8.5 out of 10 for customer satisfaction compared to 8.0 for Electrify America, 7.6 for ChargePoint and 7.0 for Blink Charging. Benzinga?s Take: There could be room for several charging infrastructure stocks to gain on the continued rollout of the additional thousands of stations promised by President Joe Biden. ChargePoint looks like it could be a big winner with its large number of stations and lead in the total number of DCFC connectors. EVgo could be a winner as it works with partners like GM and Tesla to rollout additional DCFC locations and add Tesla connectors going forward. Share Performance: CLII shares have more than doubled since announcing the deal. Switchback shares are up nearly 300% in the last year. Blink Charging shares are up over 2,000% over the last year.

2021-01-26 16:54:42 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-26 16:54:42 and 2021-01-26 21:39:00+00:00: ROCHESTER, Mich., Jan. 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new study has just been completed that fully analyzes the success of the Central Florida (Orlando) Auto Show. Starting in March of 2020 auto shows across the United States and Canada were cancelled or postponed. The Central Florida auto show was held in Orlando from December 18 to December 20 after postponing the dates originally planned. This made them the first to open during the pandemic and that has attracted a lot of attention from auto show producers, auto manufacturers and their agencies. Foresight Research immediately following the show interviewed 645 Orland residents some who attended the auto show and some that did not attend the auto show. Using the vast Foresight Research auto show database, results were then compared to past auto show attendance and non-attendance in Orlando and around the United States. The ?2020 Central Florida International Auto Show Focus Report? details the impact that the COVID-19 virus has on auto shows. Here are a few facts from the report. Not surprisingly, attendance was much lower compared to the year before. However, the profile of the attendees was in line with what you would expect. The excellent quality of the attendees was maintained with 72% being 12-month intenders ? much in line with auto shows in general and with the prior Orlando auto show. The demographics were very high and seriously upscale compared to the local Orlando residents. As to the experience, most attendees rated the show highly and dwell times were maintained. The attitudes about virtual auto shows were also investigated as well as messages that are effective in attracting attendees. The attendees were satisfied with the safety protocols. Among the non-attendees, about half specifically pointed to the pandemic and other pandemic related reasons for non-attendance such as: do not like crowds, and health issues. The number of brands participating was lower than last year. That also affected attendance. Foresight Research has provided automotive marketing research for over 20 years and is a leader of syndicated research. Foresight Research covers a wide range of subjects with emphasis on auto shows, motorsports, experiential events, and vehicle accessories.

The market witnessed a growth rate of 57.0 percent in 2020 and is expected to witness a double-digit growth rate over the next two years, according to a new report by Verify Markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a surge in demand for air treatment systems. Companies have faced difficulties in coping with the sudden increase in demand. ?At the height of the pandemic, several companies were out of stock within weeks and were unable to replenish their stock in time to keep up with the surge in purchases,? notes Shilpa Tiku, Chief Research Officer at Verify Markets. The key drivers in the market include the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-state pollution, natural disasters, and consumer education programs. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact everyday life in the U.S. and around the world, several recommendations have been instituted by various government agencies to help cope with the situation. Some of these include ensuring proper ventilation as well using air cleaners. The key challenges in the market include lack of product awareness among consumers, increasing competition, and misleading claims. Despite some companies educating consumers about the importance of air quality and helping them pick the right air treatment system for their home, there is a continuing lack of knowledge in differentiation among the various products available in the market. Several companies have included product filters and comparison tools on their websites to help customers select the air treatment system that matches their requirements. Another challenge is the low barrier to entry in this market. There are several new companies entering the market, as well as large established companies with strong brand recognition and large marketing budgets. Additionally, there are international companies, mostly from Asia, that offer low-cost products. Increasing competition is affecting the ability of small and medium companies to differentiate their products. Products priced under $150.00 were extremely popular in 2020. Retail sales was the most popular channel, however, e-commerce sales gained significant traction in 2020. Products that covered 301-400 square feet made up the majority of the sales by revenue in 2020. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the overall air treatment systems market in the United States. The report also captures market information on market dynamics like growth drivers, restraints, market revenues and forecasts, technology trends, pricing trends, distribution trends, market share by coverage area, sales by application, and the competitive landscape. The base year for the study is 2020 and the forecasts are until 2027. Some of the key companies in this market include Helen of Troy Limited, Newell Brands Inc., Guardian Technologies, LLC, Plaston Holding AG Widnau, Dyson Ltd, Blueair AB, Sharp Corporation, LG Corporation, IQAir North America, Inc., Alen Corporation, Molekule, Inc., and others.

That compares with an average analyst estimate of $2.73 billion. For 2021, the company projected a sales increase of 37%, well ahead of Wall Street expectations.AMD has struggled for decades to make sustainable gains against Intel, the world?s largest chipmaker. However, AMD has revamped its products and outsourced production, helping it create semiconductors that match or exceed the performance of Intel offerings. That has spurred early market share gains and a surge in AMD shares. ?Our 2021 financial outlook highlights the strength of our product portfolio and robust demand for high-performance computing across the PC, gaming and data center markets,? Lisa Su, AMD?s chief executive officer, said in a statement.In addition to competing with Intel in processors for personal computers and servers, AMD supplies graphics chips used in Microsoft Corp.?s Xbox and Sony Corp.?s PlayStation. New versions of these video game consoles went on sale during the recent holiday period, raising expectations for this part of AMD?s business, which rivals Nvidia Corp.AMD has its chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has better production technology than Intel. TSMC also supplies Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia and may other technology companies, and the Taiwanese company is struggling to keep up with demand.Last week, Intel reported better-than-expected earnings and gave an upbeat forecast for the first quarter. Strong demand for laptops to support working and studying from home has fueled growth and will continue in the first half of 2021, Intel said.AMD reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.45 a share, compared with $170 million, or 15 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 53% to $3.2 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was 52 cents. Analysts were looking for profit of 47 cents on sales of $3 billion. Net income was boosted by a tax benefit of $1.3 billion in the quarter, AMD said.AMD shares were little changed in extended trading following the announcement. The stock has surged almost 90% in the past year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

(NASDAQ: PEP) but the stock's reaction "overshoots the actual financial opportunity," according to JPMorgan. Whenever a small company like Beyond Meat strikes any sort of partnership with a global giant like PepsiCo, it's "usually good news," analyst Ken Goldman wrote in a note. But in reality, the financial upside for Beyond Meat is smaller than investors assume. The collaboration between the two could consist of Beyond Meat supplying PepsiCo with plant-based alternatives to cheese for its Tostitos salsa or creating a new lineup of fully vegan Doritos. Related Link: Beyond Meat Soars After Announcing Joint Venture With Pepsi While Beyond Meat should be able to supply PepsiCo with what it needs to create vegan products, the market opportunity for vegan Doritos is likely not large enough to justify the stock's surge above $200 per share. "So we would fade this news," the analyst wrote. "Maybe today (or even tomorrow) isn't the best time to do it, not with the market still forcing shorts to cover left and right." Goldman maintains an Underweight rating on Beyond Meat's stock Similarly, Wells Fargo analysts said that Beyond Meat's upside from working with PepsiCo is minimal. The two companies can find success in working together to lower sodium content but there is "no commercially viable" product the two can launch together. Cramer Chats With CEO: Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown told Jim Cramer why the partnership with PepsiCo is the most important deal in the company's history. The simple reason is that "PepsiCo is everywhere," Cramer said on CNBC. But Cramer questions if Beyond Meat's stock should have been up by more than 30% Tuesday morning. The stock has attracted short interest as some investors believe Beyond Meat has been losing ground in the growing competitive environment.' Nevertheless, short investors were not anticipating Tuesday's announcement that was the culmination of years in the making, Cramer said. BYND Price Action: Share of Beyond Meat hit a new all-time high of $221 Tuesday morning and were trading higher by 20% to $190 at publication time.

Amazon tweeted Tuesday from its official news account. ?It is clearly in SpaceX?s interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public?s interest.?The statement followed a tweet from Musk, the richest person according to data compiled by Bloomberg.?It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation,? Musk said in a tweeted reply to coverage by CNBC journalist Michael Sheetz.Musk?s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has launched more than 1,000 satellites for its Starlink internet service and is signing up early customers in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. Amazon last year won FCC permission for a fleet of 3,236 satellites and has yet to launch any.Amazon earlier urged the FCC to reject SpaceX?s request for lower orbits. It said the change would put SpaceX satellites in the midst of the Kuiper System orbits, according to filings at the agency.SpaceX pushed back in calls to the FCC, saying its plans wouldn?t increase interference for what it termed Amazon?s ?still nascent plans.?A lower orbit allows quicker internet service because the signal doesn?t travel as far. SpaceX told the FCC that having the satellites closer to Earth lessens the risk of space debris because they would fall out of orbit more quickly than higher spacecraft.SpaceX eventually plans to operate some 12,000 satellites and has won FCC authorization for about 4,400 birds, including 1,584 at 550 kilometers -- where its satellites currently orbit. The company is seeking permission to stage another 2,824 satellites at the same approximate altitude, rather than twice as high as originally proposed.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

What Happened: Chamath Palihapitiya said Tuesday he's considering a run in California with a new website. Democrat Gavin Newsom won the 2018 California governor election with 61.9% of the vote, the biggest victory by a non-incumbent since 1930. The website for Chamath for California promises to focus on 0% state taxes, $70,000 salaries for teachers, launching a global center for tech and climate jobs, free school vouchers, no student loans and $2,000 for every new child born in California. ?California is a mess ? it?s too expensive, our teachers are underpaid, and our schools aren?t good enough," the website reads. It?s on. #RecallGavinNewsom https://t.co/r8Cwd4szrn ? Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) January 26, 2021 The Chamath for California website offers the ability to get alerts by signing up for emails but doesn't currently have a place to donate to the campaign. It's unclear if Palihapitiya plans on running against Newsom in the 2022 election or only if Newsome is recalled. Related Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Chamath Palihapitiya Why it?s Important: Palihapitiya has been one of the top followed investors over the last years. His Social Capital company has launched six SPACs and has plans to offer SPACs with the tickers IPOA to IPOZ. Time will tell what a Governor run could mean for Palihapitiya?s investments and time dedication to SPACs. Palihapitiya is the Chairman of Virgin Galactic (NYSE: SPCE), which along with Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN) and Clover Health (NASDAQ: CLOV) went public via SPAC deals. Palihapitiya also has a pending deal to take SoFi public with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp V (NYSE: IPOE). SPACs Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp IV (NYSE: IPOD) and Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp VI (NYSE: IPOF) are still searching for targets.

The U.S. should get there in the second half of this year. But Italians and South Africans may have to wait until 2023 -- or even longer.Those are the dates when output in some of the world?s major economies will return to the status quo ante-Covid-19 -- the level achieved at the end of 2019, before the new coronavirus struck -- according to the latest forecasts from the International Monetary Fund. The numbers reveal an uneven global recovery after the worst recession since World War II.The pandemic has killed more than 2.1 million people, shut down businesses and frozen travel. It?s expected to widen inequality between countries and within them, and may push as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.China, the first major economy to be hit by Covid-19, was also the first to emerge from the slump. Somewhere around the end of June last year, according to official data, gross domestic product surged back past its pre-pandemic level. By the end of 2022, according to the IMF, it?ll be more than 15% larger. Some forecasters expect China to overtake the U.S. this decade as the world?s top economy.The U.S. looks set to bounce back fastest among developed economies, helped by one of the biggest infusions of fiscal cash in world history. Annual GDP should pass the end-2019 figure sometime around the middle of this year, the IMF projects. Japan is another wealthy nation that?s recovering fairly well -- and with a shrinking population, its performance may look even better when the fund publishes per-capita numbers in April.The rollout of multiple vaccines has boosted recovery hopes, and led the IMF to raise its forecast for world GDP this year. Still, even under that scenario, economies will generally be smaller than the IMF had expected in its last pre-Covid-19 forecasts, published a year ago.And in several countries -- developed ones like Spain and the U.K., and emerging ones such as Mexico -- GDP at the end of 2022 will likely still be smaller than it was before the pandemic. The new IMF predictions don?t go beyond 2022. But based on the forecast growth rates for the last quarter of that year, some economies -- notably Italy and South Africa -- may struggle to regain their pre-virus growth rates even in 2023.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

One of its most prominent members made some purchases in December that could benefit from the new Biden administration. What Happened: It was revealed over the weekend that Speaker of the House and California Rep. Nancy Pelosi purchased 25 call options of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). The purchases could have been done by Pelosi or her husband Paul, who runs a venture capital firm. The options were bought at a stake price of $500 and expiration of March 18, 2022. Pelosi paid between $500,000 and $1,000,000 for the options, according to the disclosure. Pelosi also disclosed that she bought 20,000 shares of AllianceBernstein Holdings (NYSE: AB), 100 calls of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and 100 calls of Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). Tesla shares have risen from $640.34 at the time the calls were purchased to over $890 today. The call options were valued at $1.12 million as of Monday. Related Link: How The 2020 Presidential Election Could Impact EV, Auto Stocks Why It?s Important: The purchases by Pelosi are questionable as arguments could be made that the companies stand to benefit from new President Joe Biden?s agenda. Biden's push for electric vehicles, which could include lifting the cap on sales, would give buyers tax credits again and is advantageous for Tesla. The president has also suggested a possible cash-for-clunkers program that could incentivize customers for trading in used vehicles towards the purchase of an electric vehicle. Pelosi could now have a conflict as she works to pass clean energy initiatives from which her family could profit. Former U.S. Senator David Perdue, a Republican, was criticized for making numerous stock trades during his six years in Congress. Perdue was the most prominent stock trader from Congress, making 2,596 trades during his time served. Some of Perdue?s transactions came while he was a member of several sub-committees. The Justice Department investigated Perdue and found no wrongdoing. What?s Next: It's legal for members of Congress and their spouses to own stocks. The transactions have to be disclosed per the STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act that was passed in 2012. U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon is one member of Congress who has co-sponsored legislation to ban the adding of individual stocks by members of Congress. Both Merkley and Pelosi are Democrats. Pelosi?s transactions could push for more regulations concerning stock purchases by members of Congress. (Photo: Official U.S. Embassy photograph by Archibald Sackey and Courage Ahiati.)

If you were a stockholder of record as of December 31, 2020, $0.00 is reported on your 2020 Form 1099 and $0.25 will be reported on your 2021 Form 1099. Shareholders of record of the Company?s common stock will receive an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV from Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, the Company?s 2020 dividend paying agent. The form will report the dividends paid and the amounts designated as total ordinary dividends, qualified dividends, total capital gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains, non-dividend distributions and dividends that may be eligible for the 20% qualified business income deduction under section 199A. If shares were held in ?street name? during 2020, the IRS form will be provided by a bank, brokerage firm, or nominee. Because the Company?s tax return has not yet been filed for the year ended December 31, 2020, the dividend income tax allocations presented herein have been calculated using the best available information to date. The tax treatment of these dividends by state and local authorities varies and may not be the same as the IRS?s treatment. Because federal and state tax laws affect individuals differently, the Company cannot advise shareholders on how dividends should be reported on their tax returns. The Company encourages shareholders to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the federal, state and local income tax consequences of these dividends.

Here's a look at the recent stocks' history and how options are pricing the expected move out to this Friday. Apple options are pricing about a 6% move in either direction by Jan. 29 expiration, which captures earnings: Prior Apple earnings weeks via Options AI Calendar Facebook options are also pricing about a 6% move in either direction by Jan. 29 expiration, which captures earnings. For this week, that corresponds to about $265 and $300 in the stock. And the prior Facebook earnings weeks via Options AI Calendar Using Option Spreads And The Expected Move The Options AI expected move chart helps traders visualize just how much volatility option traders are pricing into stocks like Apple and Facebook and in what timeframe. And when the expected move is large, it follows that buying options can be expensive. So, using Facebook as an example, we look at how spreads can be used to either lower that cost through buying debit spreads or generate income through selling credit spreads and how the expected move can be used to help guide strike selection. Using The Move For Bullish Spread Strategies Let's consider the scenario where as a trader you are bullish and knowing the expected move to your timeframe, you also believe that the options market is generally correct in its bullish consensus. In other words, the stock is going up, but its likely not going beyond where the market has priced a potential move. In this scenario, rather than simply buying a call option, you might choose to simultaneously sell a higher strike call at the expected move level, creating a debit call spread. This lowers the overall cost (thereby also lowering the breakeven level and increasing probability of profit) in exchange for capping potential upside (beyond where the market has priced the move). Let's look at an example as applied to Facebook. Below is a $15 debit call spread for February 19th, capturing both Demo Day, and earnings, with a breakeven in the stock near $36, and max profit above $42: View more earnings on FB Now let's look at an alternative bullish strategy that seeks not to lower cost, but rather to capitalize on higher option prices and generate income by ?selling to the bears'. Below, we see a $15 wide credit put spread, that could be viewed as essentially ?mirroring' the debit call spread ? in this case selling an at-the-money put option and simultaneously buying a put option at the expected move level (thereby limiting potential downside and defining risk). Note that maximum gain is realized with a move higher in the stock ? essentially being bullish by "selling to the bears": Whether a trader chooses a debit or a credit spread might depend on their own level of bullishness, compared to the crowd. Using The Move For Bearish Strategies The same concepts apply to spreads with a bearish view, with debit spreads to the expected move helping lower costs and lower break-evens and credit spreads risking more to make less, but with a higher probability of profit compared to debits: Using The Move For Income Generating Strategies Finally, let's consider the scenario where you believe that the options market has overpriced the move and believe that the stock will stay within the expected move on a given timeframe. When ?selling the move', Premium (or income) received from selling options is kept if the stock stays within a specific range. Here's a look at an Iron Condor for this week's expiration in Apple as an example of a neutral strategy that seeks to collect premium (income) if a stock stays within the expected move. In this example, the Iron Condor establishes a range of max gain for the trade if AAPL stock closes anywhere between $135 and $152.50 on Friday's expiry. While by no means the only basis for strike selection, setting Condor strikes at the expected move is essentially taking the other side of option market consensus, while retaining the benefits of defined risk/reward. If the stock moves beyond $130 or $157.50, the trade results in a max loss. Summary Remember, the above are just examples of the many ways a trader might express a view using option spreads. They are intended solely to demonstrate how the expected move can provide actionable insight to consider before making any trade, particularly into an uncertain event. Whether gut-checking your own expectations versus the options crowd, generating trade ideas from option market signals, or for more informed strike selection. That's why Options AI puts the expected move at the heart of its chart-based platform. Learn / Options AI has a couple of free tools as well as education on expected moves and spread trading. The concepts shown in Apple can apply to any stock and it is simply used here for illustrative purposes. The post Facebook, Apple, Earnings and Using Spreads appeared first on Options AI: Learn.

The company is scheduled to release its fiscal-year 2021 first-quarter results Wednesday after the market close. Record Revenues, EPS In Sight: Analysts, on average, estimate Apple to report first-quarter earnings of $1.41 per share on revenues of $103.28 billion. Loup Venture's Gene Munster is above consensus, with the famed Apple analyst estimating 19% year-over-year revenue growth vis-?-vis the 16.70% growth Street is modeling. The company's revenues are expected to top the $100 billion mark for the first time in its history, with the iPhone strength supporting much of the upside. Apple launched its newest iteration of the iPhone, dubbed the iPhone 12, late last year. The company had a delayed, as well as phased, launch of the iPhone 12, which came in four variants. All the four models are 5G enabled. Related Link: 10 Things Apple Investors May Wish For In 2021 Other Metrics: iPhone builds in the quarter is estimated in the low-to-mid 90 million mark, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note, citing supply chain estimates. Munster sees the share of iPhone revenues to total revenues increasing to 59% in the first quarter from the typical 50% range. He expects iPhone revenues to increase 16% to $64.9 billion compared to the Street estimate of $59.4 billion. View more earnings on AAPL Services revenue, which makes up 14% of sales, may have risen 18% year-over-year to $15 billion, the analyst estimates. Munster expects Apple to have exited the December quarter with total cash of $185 billion, comprising $112 billion in debt and $73 billion in net cash. Forward Outlook: For the March quarter, Apple is expected to report EPS of 91 cents on revenues of $74.54 billion. The consensus estimates for the fiscal year 2021 call for EPS of $4.03 on revenues of $318.9 billion. Munster sees the accelerating digital transformation serving as a tailwind for Apple's revenue growth for the next several years. Ives said Apple has the potential to sell over 240 million units of iPhones in 2021, which could surpass the previous record of 231 million units set in fiscal year 2015. AAPL Stock: Apple shares ended 2020 with a gain of about 82% at $132.69. Having experienced some weakness at the start of the year, the stock has come back and is trading with a modest gain of 4.8% for the year-to-date period. Apple valuation passed the trillion mark in August, and if the company continues to execute at this pace, a $3 trillion market cap is on the horizon over the next 12 months. Apple shares closed Tuesday's session at $143.16.

Shares of the software company increased 3.7% in Tuesday?s extended trading session. Microsoft?s (MSFT) 2Q earnings of $2.03 per share increased 34.4% year-over-year and crushed the analysts? expectations of $1.64 per share. The tech giant's 2Q revenue grew 16.8% to $43.1 billion year-over-year and topped the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion. Microsoft?s CFO Amy Hood said, ?Accelerating demand for our differentiated offerings drove commercial cloud revenue to $16.7 billion, up 34% year over year.? The tech giant's Azure segment saw 50% growth during the quarter, as more enterprises shift to cloud computing. Meanwhile, Xbox revenue was up 40% from the year-ago period. Revenues generated from the company's productivity and business processes segment increased 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, intelligent cloud and personal computing segments' sales grew 23% and 14%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. (See MSFT stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the results, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $270 (16.2% upside potential) on the stock. Ives said, ?With a vaccine being deployed globally, the WFH [work from home] shift will clearly moderate as many return to the office during the course of 2021." "However, from an IT [information technology] architecture perspective, the cloud shift will continue to gain speed as many CIOs [chief information officers] aggressively go down the digital transformation path with MSFT's Azure/Office 365 footprint as the main enterprise cloud artery,? the analyst added. Overall, the rest of the Street has a firmly bullish outlook with the analyst consensus of a Strong Buy based on 23 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target of $253.30 implies upside potential of about 9% to current levels. Shares have gained by about 42.3% in one year. What's more, MSFT scores a perfect 10 from TipRanks? Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

In the reported quarter, profit beat Street estimates, while sales fell short of expectations. Looking ahead, the coffee chain?s 2Q earnings outlook missed analysts' expectations, which dragged the stock down by 1.7% in Tuesday?s extended trading session. Starbucks? (SBUX) 1Q earnings of $0.61 per share topped Street estimates of $0.55 per share but declined 22.8% year-over-year due to lower sales and margins. Revenue fell 5% to $6.75 billion and missed analysts' forecasts of $6.93 billion. The coffee chain reported that the year-over-year decline in sales was a result of lower traffic and reduced operations amid the pandemic-led store closures. The company?s global comparable-store sales (comps) decreased by 5% year-over-year due to a 19% decline in comparable transactions. However, the average ticket increased 17% during the quarter. Comps declined 5% in the US but increased 5% in China. As for 2Q, Starbucks expects to report earnings in the range of $0.45 to $0.50 per share, which is well below analysts' estimates of $0.59 per share. For fiscal 2021, Starbucks forecasts earnings in the range of $2.70-$2.90 per share, compared to consensus estimates of $2.81 per share. The company anticipates 2021 revenue in the range of $28-29 billion, compared to analysts? expectations of $28.5 billion. Starbucks sees global comps growth of 18% to 23% in 2021. (See SBUX stock analysis on TipRanks) Ahead of the earnings results, Goldman Sachs analyst Jared Garber on Jan. 19 initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $115 (9.9% upside potential). In a note to investors, Garber said that large chains should benefit from the ?rapid digital transformation and independent restaurant challenges.? The analyst believes that Starbucks should also benefit from the economic re-opening in 2021. Overall, consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 9 Holds. The average analyst price target of $110.06 implies upside potential of about 5.1% to current levels. Shares have gained 16.1% in one year. Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial bloggers have a bullish call on the stock.

DKK 1.3bn of capital to ensure strategic and operational flexibility. Full-year outlook is maintained. ?We reached revenue of one billion DKK this quarter for the first time in Ambu?s history. This milestone is the result of the dedication and focus of our organization in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

North America grew organically by 35%, Europe by 194% and Rest of World by 35%.The Visualization growth in Europe benefited from special orders for single-use bronchoscopes to the National Health Service (NHS) in England as part of their COVID-19 strategy to treat patients and build safety stocks. These orders were expected and contributed approx. 40 percentage points of the 101% organic growth for Visualization in Q1.Anaesthesia grew 5% (8%), and Patient Monitoring & Diagnostics (PMD) declined by -3% (10%). The recovery that we have seen since second half of 2019/20 continued in Q1, but especially PMD was still negatively impacted by COVID-19.The special orders to the NHS had an impact equal to 16 percentage points to the Q1 organic growth of 39%. Excluding these orders, organic growth in Q1 would have been 23%.Sales of single-use endoscopes reached 370,000 units for the quarter. Sales volumes were thus up 106% relative to last year.We secured the clearance of our aScope? 4 Cysto in Europe and Japan and started its commercialization in these markets. As regards the aScope?

The EUR 40m milestone payment associated with FDA clearance of the duodenoscope was paid in Q1.To ensure strategic and operational flexibility, Ambu intends to raise capital in an offering of new Class B shares and existing treasury shares through an accelerated bookbuilding process.

In this context, a detailed review of schedule and cost has been performed to estimate the impact of the pandemic so far. This review has concluded the following (1): The start of electricity generation from Unit 1 is now expected in June 2026, compared to end-2025 as initially announced in 2016. The project completion costs are now estimated in the range of ?2015 22 to 23bn (2). As a consequence, the projected rate of return (IRR) for EDF is estimated between 7.1% and 7.2% (3). The risk of COD delay of Units 1 and 2 is maintained at respectively 15 and 9 months. The realisation of this risk would incur a potential additional cost in the order of ?2015 0.7bn. In this case, the IRR for EDF would be reduced by 0.3%. The project is focused on the objective to lift the Unit 1 dome at the end of 2022. (1) The information enclosed in this press release assumes the ability to begin a ramp up back to normal site conditions from the second quarter of 2021.(2) Reminder on the costs previously announced in the Press release of 25 September 2019: ?2015 21.5 ? 22.5bn. Costs net of operational action plans, in 2015 sterling, excluding interim interest and excluding forex effect versus the reference exchange rate for the project of 1 sterling = 1.23 euro. Costs are calculated by deflating estimated costs in nominal terms using the British Construction OPI for All New Work index.(3) EDF equity IRR calculated at the exchange rate of 1 sterling = 1.13 euro and including the capped compensation mechanism in place between the project?s shareholders. Previous IRR of 7.6% - 7.8% was based on an exchange rate of 1 sterling = 1.15 euro. This press release is certified.

And that breakdown in correlation bodes well for the country?s shares.The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 16% in 2020 despite more than 6 trillion yen ($58 billion) of foreign net selling in the cash and futures market, according to Japan Exchange Group data. It was the first time since 1989 that the blue-chip gauge recorded a double-digit gain amid net foreign selling.The phenomenon suggests the nation?s local investors have been playing a larger role in setting the market?s trend. The Bank of Japan was the largest domestic entity to purchase local equities last year, doling out 7.1 trillion yen in net buying. Japanese institutions including insurers and banks were also net buyers of 7.6 trillion yen worth of shares during the period, according to data compiled by Mizuho Securities Co.?It does seem clear that foreigners are not needed for a bull market anymore,? said John Vail, the chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. ?That seems like an antiquated rule of thumb that no longer applies.?While foreigners have been net buyers so far this year, they were annual net sellers of Japanese equities 13 times since 1982. The Nikkei 225 slid 12% in 2018 as net selling by foreigners reached 13.2 trillion yen. The gauge slumped 42% in 2008, when they offloaded 3.7 trillion yen of shares. The Nikkei 225 closed 0.3% higher at 28,635.21 on Wednesday.Seiichi Suzuki, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute Co., estimates for every one trillion yen in foreign buying last year, the Nikkei 225 got a boost of 5.5%. The same amount of selling weighed on it by 1.8%, indicating the market is becoming more resilient to foreign outflows, he said.Persistent BOJ buying of exchange-traded funds is helping to offset foreign sales, said Shusuke Yamada, a strategist at Bank of America. The central bank last year raised its annual purchase target to 12 trillion yen from 6 trillion yen at the height of the pandemic, although buying has slowed in recent months.BOJ Hints Review May Also Look at Ways to Spur Growth Potential?It?s a big deal that there?s someone buying whenever the market dips,? he said. ?The fact the BOJ is there to buy isn?t going to change this year.?Nikko Asset?s Vail said other domestic players are also playing a significant role in the market as they search for higher returns amid a prolonged period of low yields. Those investors will set the stage for a ?long-term bull market? regardless of which way foreigners decide to bet, he said.?It does seem like Japanese domestic investors really do understand now that the stock market is not a gambling den -- It?s a good way to invest your money,? Vail said. ?It really shows that the equity culture here now has become solid.?(Updates with Nikkei 225?s closing level in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

When hedged for fluctuations against the pound, high-grade euro corporate bonds stretching five to seven years offer a yield of 0.9% compared to 1.2% in their sterling equivalents, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes.To be sure, British companies aren?t out of the woods yet, as Brexit slows down factory deliveries and hits exporters with complex paperwork and the coronavirus pandemic slams consumer demand.Even so, some buyers are coming round to the view that British bonds are good value.Vanraes snapped up part of grocer Tesco Plc?s 750 million-euro ($910 million) sustainability-linked bond issue last week and is willing to buy new subordinated bonds from British companies ?if the issuer is solid.??There could be a chance for some corporates from the U.K. to become active in the primary market and a lot of asset managers will be less reluctant to buy,? he said.Greater DemandPeter Doherty, head of fixed income at Sanlam Investments U.K. Ltd, expects more issuance from U.K. firms, but not necessarily all driven by overseas demand.?U.K. credit looks attractive on a like-for-like basis, especially versus euro credit,? he said. ?The market does not fully appreciate the strength of businesses, particularly U.K. insurers.?Foreign investors are showing more interest in new sterling issues this year as ?the rationale for this premium is fading,?

MicaSense, the Parrot Group?s smallest subsidiary, specialized in sensors for drone-based precision farming, will be sold to AgEagle Aerial Systems, a data collection, analytics, aerial imaging services and drone company, for a total of $23m Parrot, Europe?s leading micro-drone group, plans to sell its subsidiary MicaSense to AgEagle Aerial Systems (NYSE American: UAVS), a Kansas-based drone services and solutions pioneer. This proposed sale is in line with the management of the Group?s investment portfolio, with a transaction valued at $23m. IFRS 5 ?Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations? would be applied for the Parrot Group?s consolidated accounts for 2020, to be published in March 2021. As part of its strategy to acquire technological components since 2011, Parrot gradually ramped up its interest in MicaSense from the end of 2014. In accordance with the preliminary cross-buy and sell provisions concerning the balance of the capital, Parrot?s interest reached 99% at the end of September 2019, for a total investment of ?10.5m. The subsidiary, which has been fully consolidated since 2014, represented a maximum of 10% of the Group?s revenues at end-2019; its operations have broken even since 2018, but this transaction will be slightly accretive for 2020.

Another plus point is Geo?s ?2nd Street? chain of stores, which sell used clothes, shoes and electronics.Geo estimates that the secondhand market in Japan will nearly double in size in 2025 to 3.5 trillion yen ($33.8 billion) from 2015, with online flea market Mercari Inc. another beneficiary of this trend. As movie rental sales decline, Geo has seen the segment make up an increasing share of its business.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

PepsiCo rose 1.2% at the close on Jan. 26. Financial terms of the partnership weren?t disclosed. However, Beyond Meat (BYND) believes that the venture will provide the plant-based meat maker with access to more customers as it enters new product categories and distribution channels. For the purpose of the joint venture, Beyond Meat and PepsiCo (PEP) will create a new entity called The PLANeT Partnership, LLC (TPP). ?We are thrilled to formally join forces with PepsiCo in The PLANeT Partnership, a joint venture that unites the tremendous depth and breadth of their distribution and marketing capabilities with our leading innovation in plant-based protein,? said Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown. ?PepsiCo represents the ideal partner for us in this exciting endeavor, one of global reach and importance." The joint venture will make use of what it called positive ingredients through tools and techniques such as regenerative agriculture and net water- and carbon-neutral production plants. The partnership comes after Beyond Meat earlier this month teamed up with Yum Brands? (YUM) subsidiary Taco Bell to develop plant-based protein. Over the past year, the company has forged partnerships to enter additional international markets, including Brazil and China, to shift its sales to retail as the coronavirus pandemic is boosting the appetite for healthier eating, while outdoor dining options are limited and consumption in supermarkets is increasing. As of Sept. 26, Beyond Meat sold products at about 122,000 retail and foodservice outlets in over 80 countries worldwide. The company?s recent deals have helped BYND?s share price surge 48% over the past month. Following the steep rally, the average analyst price target of $109 now indicates downside potential of about 42% from current levels. Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh views the PepsiCo joint venture ?very favorably? and believes ?this represents another attractive longer-term driver for BYND to capture more share in the expanding plant-based food ecosystem.? For now, however, Parikh remains sidelined on the stock with a Hold rating as he awaits financial details of the partnership, but suspects ?this likely is not impactful to BYND's results for at least a few quarters.? ?We see a tricky setup from here with challenging fundamentals amidst increasing competition at retail and difficulties at food-service. However, short interest remains quite elevated at 38.1% of float,? the analyst commented. The rest of the Street has a cautiously bearish outlook on the stock. The Moderate Sell analyst consensus shows 7 Sells, and 9 Holds, versus only 1 Buy. (See BYND stock analysis on TipRanks). Meanwhile, TipRank's hedge fund trading activity tool shows that confidence in BYND is currently very positive as 4 hedge funds increased their cumulative holdings in the stock by 30.7K shares in the last quarter.

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said.Oil has jumped almost 50% since the end of October but the rally has faltered recently on concerns about the near-term demand outlook due to Covid-19. China is facing a resurgent outbreak, there are fears about virus variants, while the U.K. became the first nation in Europe with 100,000 deaths.?With U.S. supplies shrinking and OPEC+ still keeping a tight rein on the other part of the supply equation, the market is expected to be in a deficit despite the reduced demand from the resurgent virus,? said Howie Lee, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore.Russia plans to cut exports next month to keep crude for domestic use, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are trimming output, and Libyan shipments are being affected by internal turmoil. Brent?s prompt timespread was 29 cents in backwardation -- where near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones -- compared with a 7-cent contango at the start of the month.U.S. fuel stockpiles, meanwhile, expanded last week, the API reported.

Meanwhile, the company reported better-than-expected 1Q results. F5 Networks? (FFIV) 1Q earnings of $2.59 per share grew 1.6% year-over-year and topped the Street estimates of $2.46 per share. The company's revenues of $626 million rose 10% year-over-year and exceeded analysts' expectations of about $624 million. F5?s CEO Fran?ois Locoh-Donou said, ?Our investments over the last several years have fueled innovation, enhancing our strategic position with customers at a time when they are experiencing explosive application growth, and contributing to our 10% revenue growth in the first quarter.? First-quarter revenue was driven by 70% growth in software sales, 5% growth in systems revenue and 1% growth in global services revenue. As for 2Q, F5 Networks expects earnings in the range of $2.32-$2.44 per share compared to analysts? expectations of $2.41 per share. However, F5 Networks? 2Q revenue guidance of $625-645 million came in below the analysts? forecast of about $621.66 million. (See FFIV stock analysis on TipRanks). On Jan. 25, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Silverstein raised the stock?s price target to $255 (22.3% upside potential) from $223 and maintained a Buy rating.

Overall, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 7 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $206.09 implies downside potential of about 1.2% to current levels. That's after shares gained 53.6% over the past year.

The bets total 50,000 contracts, a notional value of $5 billion, and stand to profit from a rise in benchmark yields to about the 1.37% level.The strategy can tolerate a decline in yields to around the 0.82% level, but a drop below that exposes the investor to losses of over $4 million per basis point. The 10-year yield stood at 1.04% Wednesday.As the Asian trading session for Treasuries and their various derivatives is typically quiet, the bets stand out as they were executed in blocks, which are less common. This suggests the same investor is likely behind the strategy, and could well be a holder of Treasuries in the region that is looking to hedge a position.The benchmark yield has pared its post-U.S. election surge in recent days, falling to 1.03% Monday from a high of 1.19% on Jan. 12. But the possibility of a Biden administration fiscal-relief package remains, and there is still enthusiasm in the so-called reflation trade that drove yields back above the key 1% level earlier this month.See here for how the Treasury risk reversal was built up to 50,000The bearish wager is at odds with other recent prints in the market. One stand out trade was a sale of options expiring in February, in a wager that yields will remain in a tight range until then.Here is a list of some of the trades in the risk-reversal strategy:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

But breakneck increases in processing were scuppered last year when mass lockdowns hammered demand for chocolate, a luxury item that benefits from impulse buying, gifting and dining out.Processing is likely to be flat in the first quarter compared with a year ago, and for the full year may rise 2% to 3% from the 830,241 tons in 2020, Lee said. Still, any pickup will be ?heavily reliant? on a recovery from Covid-19 and resumption of travel, which means grinds may even shrink if the pandemic worsens. ?This is such an unprecedented market with unprecedented curveballs thrown at everyone, regardless of which part of the supply chain you sit in.?Chocolate CravingStill, one bright spot for demand are Asia?s tech-savvy, chocoholic millennials. In China, the virus has driven younger consumers to e-commerce online channels to get their fix of sweet treats, Lee said. While confectionery has had little success with the older demographic that prefers traditional fruit-based or other desserts, chocolate has become a lifestyle choice for the younger crowd.Consumption has boomed through quick service restaurants and the growth of cafes like Starbucks, as well as the rising popularity of luxury treats like single-origin chocolate and chocolate-based beverages and desserts, he said. Millennials are ?the great chocolatey hope? in Asia, he said.India, meanwhile, remains a ?very important? market as chocolate is a popular gifting option, Lee said. ?India?s interest in chocolate and growth in chocolate consumption is on par, if not stronger, than China.?For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

The growing pollution levels in many countries are the primary factors fueling the popularity of electric vehicles. Moreover, the rising requirement for electric two- and three-wheelers in ride hailing and sharing services and the growing deployment of electric three-wheelers for goods and passenger transportation are pushing up the sales of electric two- and electric three-wheelers across the world. The lack of proper charging facilities and the frequent charging requirements of these vehicles pose big problems for vehicle owners.As a result, many organizations are focusing on developing vehicles equipped with battery-swapping features. This eliminates the requirement for the ownership of batteries by the owners of the electric vehicles. Instead, the batteries are owned and supplied by the swapping service providers. The separation of the batteries from the electric vehicles reduces the costs of electric vehicles. This, in turn, makes the prices of electric vehicles either similar to or in some cases, lower than internal engine combustion (ICE) automobiles.The global EV battery swapping for two- and three-wheeler market is predicted to surge from 2020 to 2030. The growing popularity of electric scooter sharing service is a key factor fueling the progress of the market. These services have witnessed a sharp rise in popularity in North America in recent years. This is because these services offer better last-mile connectivity and hyper-localized services in comparison to other shared mobility services.Across the globe, the EV battery swapping for two- and three-wheeler market is currently registering the highest growth in Asia-Pacific (APAC), as per the observations the publisher. In this region, the market is presently booming in India and China, mainly because of the high population density and the high usage of two-wheelers in these countries. The market is also rapidly progressing in Taiwan, on account of the growing popularity of battery swapping in the country.Hence, it can be said without any doubt that the market would demonstrate rapid expansion throughout the world in the forthcoming years, primarily because of the growing deployment of electric two- and three-wheelers and the rising requirement for battery swapping, on account of the lack of proper charging infrastructure and high prices of lithium-ion batteries, around the world.

The offering was more than double the size of the government's first US$1 billion green bond in 2019. The city's government announced nearly three years ago that it would seek to issue up to HK$100 billion (US$12.9 billion) in green bonds as it strives to become an international green finance centre. "The success of the offering demonstrates investor confidence in Hong Kong's credit strengths and economic fundamentals in the long term," Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said in a news release. "The issuance will help catalyse further growth of the green and sustainable bond market, particularly leveraging on Hong Kong's strengths as a leading green finance hub in the region." Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China. Green bonds are fixed-income products designed to fund projects that are environmentally friendly. The announcement came as the Airport Authority Hong Kong was marketing its own 10-year and 30-year US dollar-denominated debt on Wednesday, marking the second time it has come to the market since issuing US$1.5 billion in senior perpetual capital securities in December. Proceeds from the green bond sale will go to the city's Capital Works Reserve Fund to finance or refinance public works projects that provide environmental benefits and support the sustainable development of Hong Kong. The green bond offering comprised a US$1 billion five-year tranche, a US$1 billion 10-year tranche and a US$500 million 30-year tranche. The bonds are expected to be settled on February 2 and be listed on the Hong Kong and London stock exchanges. The pricing attracted strong interest, with investors making more than US$15 billion of pledges within hours of the books opening, according to a person familiar with the matter. Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city's latest green bond issuance will help catalyse further grow Hong Kong's green financing market.

Photo: Handout The five-year and 10-year tranches attracted orders more than five times their respective issuance sizes, while the 30-year tranche attracted orders more than seven times the issuance size, according to the HKMA. About 65 per cent of the overall allocation went to Asian institutional investors, reflecting the appetite for green financial products in Asia, according to the HKMA. About 20 per cent went to European investors and 15 per cent to US investors, with a strong preference by Western investors for longer tenor bonds. Banks received 34 per cent of the allocation, with 46 per cent going to fund managers and 20 per cent to central banks, sovereign nationals and others, the HKMA said. Credit Agricole and HSBC acted as joint global coordinators on the offering.

Global Eyewear Market will surpass US$ 150.43 Billion by the end of the year 2026.As rising eye problems among teenagers and cataract problems for aged peoples, including elders with presbyopia and myopia drive the value growth for eyewear globally. Asian countries such as India and China are the leading countries in the global eyewear marketplace. The adoption of digital tools, such as virtual try-on and tele-optometry, through which eye test is done nowadays, is the factors accelerating the e-commerce delivery platform's growth. There is a rise in the growth of premium brands as the belief of quality products and attractive designs boost the eyewear industry's growth. In this report, the global eyewear market is segmented into spectacles, sunglasses, contact lenses and eyewear frame. The spectacles segment further divided into frames and lens. Sunglasses have been segmented into Plano and prescription sunglasses. Contact lenses are divided into two parts multifocal and sphere. Moreover, Spectacles lenses market has projected to maintain its dominating position at the end of the forecast year. This market trend has owed to the increasing prevalence of hypermetropia and myopia.Over the last years, many leading international companies influence various distribution channels, particularly online retailing, to drive market penetration over the traditional store. There are many products in women's eyewear (heavy trendy eyeglasses, vintage round glasses and hipster silhouettes) are trending in the market. In men's eyewear (gold metal eyeglasses, Dark Lenses, Wayfarers and Classic Aviators) are increasing the market demand. International leading luxury brands like Giorgio Armani, Cartier, Prada, and Gucci have started selling their premium eyewear products globally.In recent years, the advancement of technology, such as eye check-up through computer or smartphone by medical professionals and the rising prevalence of eyesight and vision deficiencies, will drive eyewear market growth in the forecast period. Covid-19 addresses evolving challenges for the eyewear industry due to lockdown. People are more concerned about purchasing a product through stores and shopping malls because of shape and size, and other hands have disrupted manufacturing and supply chain management.Global eyewear market is likely to bounce back well from 2021 onwards as spectacles and contact lenses will benefit from their value as medical devices. However, it eases the users to see and therefore, to function better daily. The global eyewear industry's significant challenges were that the market was broadly insulated by increasing consumer price sensitivity. Thus, the consumer purchases these things through their entire life savings where possible throughout the forecast period. Key Topics Covered: 1. Introduction2. Research & Methodology3.

The name of the entrepreneur, who turns 68 this year, was missing from a list of nine members of HNA Group's Communist Party committee, the major decision-making body akin to the board of directors in the aviation-to-property conglomerate, according to an announcement on the company's WeChat account. HNA Group's spokespeople declined to comment. Gu Gang, the executive chairman of HNA Group and head of the working group responsible for untangling HNA Group's 500 billion yuan debt, had set a goal to "deepen and advance the risk settlement work of HNA Group based on law-based and market-based principles to return [the company] to heath and facilitate its stable and long-term growth," according to a summary of his speech. Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China. The omission is a dramatic exit by an entrepreneur whose global shopping spree of everything banks to hotels totalled at least 1 trillion yuan (US$154.8 billion) of assets as recently as in 2017, fuelling his ambition to make it among the Fortune 100 list of the world's largest companies by assets. Chen has been barred from luxury spending since September last year under a court order, after a subsidiary of HNA Group failed to pay an investor in a lawsuit. Source: Various public records alt=Source: Various public records HNA Group, which Chen founded in 1993 in Hainan, had ballooned into a global conglomerate with 290,000 employees by 2017. The group started as Hainan Airlines, operating four aircraft to improve transport links between mainland China and its home base on Hainan island, long regarded as "China's Hawaii" for its tropical beaches, azure waters and holiday resorts. Fuelled by bank loans and armed with money earned from its aviation business, HNA Group went shopping, raking up stakes in Hilton Hotels and Resorts, Deutsche Bank and Ingram Micro, among dozens of other brand name assets. The acquisition spree came to an end in 2017 when China's financial regulators, fearful of risks to the banking industry, cracked down on the debt-fed binge. In February 2020, a working group comprising government officials representing the aviation regulator and Hainan provincial authorities was formed to restructure HNA Group's finances. The conglomerate has been selling assets to pay back debt amid liquidity crunch. It also faces the risk of its stakes being wiped out in overseas entities such as Swissport, the Switzerland-based airport cargo handling firm, and Virgin Australia, the second largest carrier in Australia. The restructuring plan of the group could be finalised soon, as Gu said on Monday that the overall risk settlement plan is gradually being hammered out. HNA Group should improve its communication with creditors, in light of its failure to repay its bondholders, which scared away investors.

What Happened: In September, the Game Pass service had 15 million subscribers. The latest figures represent a 20% jump in subscriptions. Nadella said Xbox was gaining console market share as ?gamers recognize the value of our broader ecosystem.? The Xbox Live ? the online service for Xbox One ? now has more than 100 million monthly active users, disclosed Nadella. The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant surpassed $5 billion in gaming revenue for the first time this quarter, said Nadella. ?The launch of Xbox series X and series S was the most successful in our history with the most devices ever sold in a launch month,? the executive said in the earnings call. Why It Matters: Microsoft revenue rose 17% year-over-year to $43.1 billion, beating Street estimates of $40.2 billion. Xbox business saw growth of 40% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts said in November that even though rival Sony Corporation?s (NYSE: SNE) PlayStation 5 might outsell the new Xbox consoles, Redmond?s Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) like $10 per month Game Pass service gives it an edge. This month, Microsoft admitted it ?messed up? the pricing of its Xbox Live Gold subscription service, which led to gamer outrage. The company has since rolled back the prices and said it would let users access free-to-play games without the need for Gold membership. Price Action: Microsoft shares rose 3.7% in the after-hours session to $240.92 on Tuesday after ending the regular session 1.22% higher at $232.33.

That followed Tuesday?s 93% surge, which meant GameStop has risen more than eightfold this month in a dizzying rally fueled by Reddit-charged day traders.Following a frenzied session on Tuesday, the stock?s gains reached new extremes outside regular hours after Tesla Inc. chief Musk tweeted a link to a Reddit thread about the company. Famed fund manager Michael Burry warned that the manic rally has gotten out of hand, calling the stock?s rise ?unnatural, insane, and dangerous.?GameStop?s surge has captivated Wall Street and stymied short sellers including Gabe Plotkin?s Melvin Capital and Andrew Left?s Citron Research. It has also spurred calls for a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, though experts say it?s difficult to prove chat-room posts are part of an illicit scheme to manipulate the market.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Apple has. Apple's Debt According to the Apple's most recent financial statement as reported on October 30, 2020, total debt is at $112.44 billion, with $98.67 billion in long-term debt and $13.77 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $38.02 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $74.42 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Apple's $323.89 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.35. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

After all, that's what determines investors' outcomes. What Happened: The GraniteShares XOUT U.S. Large Cap ETF (NYSE: XOUT) proves what's left matters, too. Investors seem to agree because XOUT, which debuted in October 2019, recently topped $100 million in assets under management. ?XOUT takes a novel approach to passive ETF investing by seeking to avoid losers being disrupted by technological innovation, rather than picking winners,? according to GraniteShares. ?The XOUT methodology examines the 500 largest U.S. companies and excludes the bottom 250 stocks deemed most at risk using a rules-based, quantitative-driven framework.? Why It's Important: XOUT tracks the XOUT US Large Cap Index. One of the pillars of the fund is eschewing stocks based on historical performance and avoiding companies that are ill-equipped to deal with changing, disruptive macro and market trends. Data confirm XOUT's methodology works as the ETF is higher by almost 31% over the past year. ?Since fund inception, the XOUT Index has returned 49.33% compared to the S&P 500?s 33.70% return, resulting in 15.63% outperformance,? according to GraniteShares. Proving what's left makes a difference, XOUT allocates just 0.04% of its weight to energy stocks and has no exposure to the utilities sectors. Those were the two worst-performing groups in the S&P 500 last year. XOUT focuses on factors such as revenue growth, employee growth, reinvestment in company stock, earnings sentiment, research and development, management performance and profitability to determine what stocks should not make the cut. What's Next: Of course, what's included in XOUT matters, too. That includes a roughly combined 64% weight to the technology, consumer discretionary and communication services sectors, giving the fund a growth feel. Some of XOUT's obvious growth components include Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). The fund also has plenty of quality with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) found among its top 10 holdings. XOUT charges 0.60% per year, or $60 on a $10,000 investment.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at $142.13, after a 0.72% drop. However, over the past month, the stock increased by 6.29%, and in the past year, by 75.55%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 2.04%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. View more earnings on AAPL Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. Apple Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 43.65 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 25.4 of the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. Ideally, one might believe that Apple Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued. Price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) all deliver quarterly results after the close. Before that, we?ll barely have time to digest a Fed meeting and chew over last night?s results from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) and others. It?s a full, rich day. Looking for a sense of what to expect when AAPL, FB, and TSLA report? There?s more detail on each right here on Ticker Tape, if you check our Earnings preview page. This morning started with stocks backing away from recent highs in a pretty sharp downturn ahead of the open despite better than solid MSFT earnings (more below). A few things might be pushing stock indices down. First of all, there?s continued worries about the slowness of vaccines getting out. There also could be a little profit taking from the recent record highs. The third factor is this crazy action in GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), which might be making people nervous because they?re unclear what?s going on. Today you?re seeing some of this same drama with shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC). It?s interesting what?s happening in these, but it might be better to be in the stands than on the field, so to speak. GME is trading on things people don?t understand. Shares of GME accelerated again Tuesday, jumping an incredible 92%?and doubled again in the overnight hours Wednesday. There appears to be a short squeeze taking place?with at least two prominent short sellers announcing this morning they?ve covered their positions?but more dramatic moves can?t be ruled out. Microsoft Earnings Receive A Rowdy Wall Street Welcome Today we?ll see if Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) can bust out of a disappointing pattern it?s been in where the company reports great earnings and the stock pulls back. That didn?t appear to be the case Wednesday, with shares up 1.5% in the overnight session after MSFT beat expectations on almost every metric with fiscal Q2 results. You name the business area?personal computing, cloud, Xbox?and MSFT shattered Wall Street?s projections. It?s pretty impressive to see the gaming segment rise 40% after the introduction of Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X. The cloud also looked very nice, with Azure revenue up 50%. That?s compared with a 48% rise in the previous quarter, and when sequential growth gains steam from a base that was already so hot, it?s a good sign the business is thriving. Overall intelligent cloud revenue of $14.6 billion came in nearly $1 billion ahead of the average Street estimate. All told, the company?s $43 billion in revenue was around $3 billion above analysts? estimates and easily topped MSFT?s own guidance that had disappointed investors when it last reported in October. Remember: A company can make a lot of adjustments to help dress up an earnings per share number, but it?s harder to hide a bad revenue reading. MSFT?s Q2 revenue revealed a business that appears to be firing on all cylinders. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) reported after the close yesterday just as some large states like California and Illinois eased their stay-at-home orders. Restaurants in parts of these states reopened recently, but that doesn?t necessarily mean you can sit down and enjoy a coffee at the SBUX near you. The company is keeping some stores closed for sit-down business based on its own ?heat map? of local conditions. The issue of closed stores might be hurting the U.S. business, where same-store sales slumped and overall revenue missed the Street?s expectations. Shares stumbled nearly 3% in pre-market trading. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) also stumbled despite a decent looking quarter. The company beat Wall Street estimates on top- and bottom lines, lifted by strong gaming demand. Guidance also looked strong. The weak stock market response might reflect a buy the rumor, sell the fact situation, with the stock up 85% over the last year. The other big chip maker reporting yesterday was Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN), and they also beat Wall Street projections. The semiconductor space is on a nice earnings run, but TXN, like AMD, didn?t enjoy a pre-market boost. It hit an all-time high last week. See more below on the chip sector. Washington and the virus got pushed into the background a little with all the earnings news, but it was good to hear that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) plans to share its Phase 3 vaccine results by early next week. Fed Meeting Can?t Be Ignored, But Big News Not Expected The Fed meeting concludes at 2 p.m. ET today, followed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell?s press conference. Analysts seem to agree that Powell is going to re-emphasize the Fed?s continued commitment to dovish policy and current levels of bond buying?one possible reason why Treasury yields lost ground ahead of the meeting. It?s the Fed so you have to pay attention, but it?s kind of hard to imagine much new coming out of this one. One difference is that for the first time in four years, the Fed is meeting under a new president and Treasury secretary. Of course, the Treasury secretary should be very familiar to Fed watchers, with former Fed Chair Janet Yellen taking the helm this week. This potentially sets up more of a triumvirate than we saw over the last six months, when the Trump administration wasn?t as clearly committed to new stimulus even as Powell kept beating the drum for more fiscal response. Yellen emphasized the importance of stimulus in her Senate confirmation hearings. The triumvirate of President Biden, Yellen, and Powell all pushing for more stimulus could be helped by a Congress that now tilts just barely to the Democrats. While there?s still a lot of maneuvering taking place on Capitol Hill around timing and size, Powell now has more power behind the Fed throne to take this fight to a higher level than he did, say, a month ago. It?ll be interesting to hear if he?s asked at the press conference about what size and shape he?d like an additional stimulus to take. He?ll probably also be pressed again on what sort of conditions the Fed might want to see before beginning to taper some of the dramatic monetary accommodations it?s making. The CME?s FedWatch tool shows futures traders predicting no chance of a Fed rate hike from until September at the earliest. Chances for a hike by then aren?t exactly running too hot, at 6.1%. CHART OF THE DAY: LOOKING FOR SUPPORT? The S&P 500 Index (SPX?candlestick) has wavered a bit over the last few sessions as it pivots near recent record highs. If selling gathers steam, one possible technical support point might be found at the 20-day moving average (blue line), which sits just below 3790. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Talking Technicals: The S&P 500 Index (SPX) is right near all-time highs, but there?s a hint that some of this incredible enthusiasm might be fading a bit. If the going gets muddier, one place to look for possible technical support is the 20-day moving average, which recently sat near 3790. That?s still a ways below the market, however. The SPX dropped to its 20-day MA on Jan. 15 and quickly rebounded. It also approached it and even fell under it for a few days in December and early January, but ?buy the dip? enthusiasm prevented any real chart damage from being done. The 50-day moving average is very close to the psychological 3700 level, so that could be another place to check for support on any sharper downward moves. Semi-Tough to Pin Down: Pick a riddle, and it probably applies to semiconductors and the chip industry. You hold it in your hand every day but you never see it. You know what it does but not how it works. It?s one of the biggest industries in the world but you need a microscope to see it. And as we reported above, companies like AMD and TXN can beat on earning
2021-01-27 15:16:23 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-27 15:16:23 and 2021-01-27 14:55:04+00:00: Each day, Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that happened on this date. What Happened? On this day in 2010, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPad. Where Was The Market? The S&P 500 traded at 1,097.50 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded at 10,236.16. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, a healthcare reform bill also known as ?Obamacare.? The explosion of the BP plc (NYSE: BP) Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico triggered the largest marine oil spill in history. The average cost of a new house in the U.S. was $232,880. Apple Launches Tablets: On Jan. 27, 2010, Apple unveiled its highly anticipated iPad tablet for the first time. Just three years after the launch of the original iPhone in 2007, CEO Steve Jobs was looking to prove that the massively successful Apple smartphone wasn?t a fluke. The original Pad was 0.5 inches thick, weighed 1.5 pounds and cost just $499. ?iPad creates and defines an entirely new category of devices that will connect users with their apps and content in a much more intimate, intuitive and fun way than ever before,? Jobs said at the time. Plenty of people were skeptical of the tablet format, which they saw at the time as more bulky than an iPhone and less useful than a laptop. However, the iPad was a huge commercial success. Apple reported $2.16 billion in iPad sales in the third quarter of 2010. By the first quarter of 2011, that number had jumped to $4.37 billion. In the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported a record $11.46 billion in iPad sales alone. Investors who bought Apple shares on the day the iPad was unveiled are also very happy. Since that day, Apple?s total return has been 2,140% compared to just a 335% total return for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY).

Geographically, Greater China region stood out, with 57% year-over-year increase in revenues. Apple's Key Numbers: First-quarter net income came in at $28.76 billion or $1.68 per share compared to $22.24 billion or $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues topped the $100 billion mark for the first time ever, coming in at $111.44 billion, up 21.4% year-over-year from $91.82 billion reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Analysts, on average, estimated earnings of $1.41 per share on revenues of $103.28 billion. International sales as a percentage of total sales were at 64% compared to 59% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 61% in the first quarter of 2020. Gross margin came in at 39.78%. This compares to 38.16% in the previous quarter and 38.4% in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow was at a record $38.8 billion. "Our December quarter business performance was fueled by double-digit growth in each product category, which drove all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments and an all-time high for our installed base of active devices," said CFO Luca Maestri. Related Link: Apple Could Be Looking At More Partnerships In EV Quest: Analyst Apple's Product, Segmental Revenue Breakdown: Americas, which accounted for 41.56% of Apple's total sales, saw year-over-year revenue growth of 11.95%. Revenue growth in Europe, the next biggest contributor, was at 17.33% to $27.31 billion. Greater China and Japan contributed 19.13% and 7.44%, respectively to total sales. These two regions saw revenue growth of 57% and 3.31%, respectively. View more earnings on AAPL Apple's flagship product, the iPhone, fetched the company $65.60 billion in sales by virtue of 17.23% year-over-year growth. It accounted for 58.86% of the total revenues. Loup Venture's Gene Munster had expected the share of iPhone revenues to total revenues increasing to 59% from the typical 50% range. He had modeled 16% growth in iPhone revenues to $64.9 billion compared to the Street estimate of $59.4 billion. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives was looking for volume shipments in the range of low-to-mid 90 million. Incidentally, Apple stopped reporting unit numbers for iPhones. Apple launched its newest iteration of iPhone, dubbed the iPhone 12, late last year. The company had a delayed as well as phased launch of the iPhone 12, which came in four variants. Ives sees the launch kickstarting a Super Cycle, as 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are in the window of an upgrade opportunity. Sales of Mac and iPad came in at $8.66 billion and $8.44 billion, respectively. Wearables, home and accessories sales climbed about 30% to $12.97 billion. The Services segment revenue growth accelerated to about 24% to $15.76 billion, exceeding the $15 billion modeled by Munster. Apple Dividend: Apple's board declared a cash dividend of 20.5 cents per share, payable on Feb. 11, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Feb. 8. Apple's Outlook: For the March quarter, Street estimates Apple to report EPS of 91 cents on revenues of $74.54 billion. The consensus estimates for the fiscal year 2021 call for EPS of $4.03 on revenues of $318.9 billion. Apple shares ended 2020 with a gain of about 82% at $132.69. Having experienced some weakness at the start of the year, the stock has come back and is trading with a modest gain of 8% for the year-to-date period. Reacting to the results, Apple shares were little changed at $142.01 in the after-hours session. The stock ended the regular session down 0.77% to $142.06.

2021-01-27 20:22:14 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-27 20:22:14 and 2021-01-27 22:11:12+00:00: ?Risk-off? resurfaced in a major way Wednesday, sending volatility soaring and stocks tumbling as the Fed meeting ended and investors prepared for a triumvirate of Tech earnings. Concerns about the slow process of vaccination appeared to hurt the market, along with cautious words from the Fed. Wednesday?s losses for the major indices were the worst in three months, and banished the S&P 500 Index (SPX) into negative territory for 2021. Small-caps and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) also took a hit, but the broader SPX fell more sharply. A Tough Day At The (Home) Office Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting press conference that it would be a long road to recovery, and that appeared to add to the late selling pressure on Wall Street. Selling intensified toward the close as the SPX plunged more than 2.5% to below what some analysts had seen as a technical support level that stood near 3750. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield sank to just above 1% by late in the session. It was at nearly 1.2% earlier this month. Weakness in the 10-year yield put pressure on the Financial sector, and so-called ?defensive? sectors, along with bonds, saw more buying interest. There had been this belief that a vaccine would be a magic potion that would sort of pick everything up, but Powell put things in more realistic terms. It takes a while to recover, and that?s why rates remain unchanged and the Fed?s bond-buying program continues. Profit taking could be another factor in the selling, since major indices had all posted record highs this month. All this came ahead of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) earnings after the close. Price Action + Earnings Uncertainty = Volatility The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), sometimes seen as a measure of fear in the market, skyrocketed around 30% to above 30 after being below 22 last week. It?s the first time it?s taken out the 30 barrier since early November. A prolonged move above 30 in VIX or below 1% in the 10-year yield would present a possible crossroads for either of those vectors. Going through one or both of those lines could draw more sellers into stocks, or it could indicate to investors that maybe the selloff has gone far enough. Wild activity around some ?short squeezes? this week in stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) might be another factor today. For some investors, it might signal a little froth in the market overall. As noted here a couple days ago, it?s absolutely normal for the major indices to have two or three 5% drops and at least one correction of 10% every year, and we haven?t seen anything close to that since last September when the SPX fell about 9.6% over a few weeks. It would probably be less normal if things just kept going up without stopping, the way they had been since around early November. With investors shying away from risk on Wednesday, and some of the more defensive sectors like Staples and Real Estate did a little better than the overall indices. It?s also interesting to note that earnings season has been pretty decent so far, and the Tech sector was one of the best performers today on a huge day for earnings in that sector. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) results yesterday looked pretty stellar. Meanwhile, ?reopening stocks? like Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS), Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), airline, and casino companies took a beating Wednesday. Some of the better performers included more ?defensive? stocks like Campbell Soup Company (NYSE: CPB), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE: HPE), Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX), Kroger Co (NYSE: KR), and 3M Co (NYSE: MMM). Fed Keeps Zero-Rate Policy, Says Growth Has ?Moderated? Not too surprisingly, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) signaled miniscule interest rates are here to stay as the U.S. economy continues to tiptoe on thin ice. What?s more, the Fed also tried to provide reassurance that the ?T? word, as in taper, isn?t yet in the Central Bank?s vocabulary. We?re still far below the Fed?s dual mandate of 2% inflation and maximum employment (see more below). The Fed left the policy unchanged with the Fed funds interest rates at 0?0.25%, where it?s been since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last March. Staying steady offered reassurance the Fed will continue to support the economy?s recovery with low rates and bond purchases that won?t let up in the near future. Today?s statement underscored how the balancing act is still being squared and any changes to the Fed?s dovish stance aren?t coming any time soon. The policy statement repeated words we?ve heard before: letting inflation run ?moderately? ahead of the 2% goal to battle unemployment. One interesting change was that the Fed left out some references to ?timing? from its statement. After its previous meeting in December, the Fed said the health crisis ?will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.? Today?s statement left out the words ?near term? and ?medium term? from that phrase. And instead of ?will continue,? the statement says, ?continues.? In Powell?s press conference after the meeting, he said they took the word ?medium term? out because the issues the economy faces like vaccinations and new cases are all happening now. The words ?medium term,? he said, is more a description of what he called ?long-term scarring? to the economy. The Fed added that the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, as it?s said in the past, but with the new phrase ?including progress on vaccinations,? added to that sentence. Like the rest of us, the Fed has a close eye on vaccine progress and can only be a spectator to that particular battle. Powell?s Still In The Fed?s Tool Shed As a reminder, the Fed?s monthly bond purchases have been coming in two forms: $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage-backed debt. Powell said there?s no plan to change either anytime soon, and that if the Fed does decide to go the tapering direction, it will give investors plenty of warning and do any tapering very gradually. The Fed did this successfully after the 2008 financial crisis ended and has learned from that experience, he added. ?We think our policy stance is just right,? Powell said. ?It?s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring. There?s strong activity in interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing, durable goods, and automobile sales. What?s holding the economy back isn?t lack of policy support from the Fed, it?s the spread of disease.? Powell acknowledged that inflation could potentially tick up a couple times in the near future. First, when the economy ?laps? the steep drop in prices seen last March and April, and then later in the year when presumably everything starts to open up. Both of these inflation events will probably be ?transient,? Powell said, and will ?likely pass.? He said investors can expect the Fed to ?wait and see and not react? to any inflation from these events. The Fed remains committed to getting inflation back to its 2% goal, and said the whole focus in the market on a possible taper ?is premature.? In his press conference, Powell addressed the recent jump in jobless claims, the high number of people who remain unemployed due to the pandemic, and the slump in service sector jobs like ones at restaurants and hotels. CHART OF THE DAY: BOUNCING OFF SUPPORT. After finally breaking out above 1% which was a resistance level of an ascending triangle pattern (blue lines), the 10-year Treasury Index (TNX?candlestick) revisited that level today. Today?s action shows it bouncing off that 1% level so it could now be acting as a support level. Price action around that level could be something to keep an eye on. Data source: Cboe Global Markets.

2021-01-28 08:59:48 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-28 08:59:48 and 2021-01-28 10:27:17+00:00: Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company?s more than $800 billion valuation is justified as there is a ?roadmap? to it. What Happened: Musk?s back of the envelope math revolves around an assumed shipment of $50 or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles becoming Full Self-Driving and get deployed as robotaxis. The usage of those cars would then jump from 12 hours a week to 60 hours a week, according to Musk. The automaker would be able to garner additional fees for the use of these robotaxis, thus bringing in a new stream of revenue. The executive said that he suspects that some investors are taking that approach to valuing the company. Why It Matters: Musk?s mathematics assumes a fivefold increase in the utility of the vehicles due to FSD, but even if there is a 2x increase, the $1 trillion valuation is still a probability.

So -- and the pace you get 20 PE on that, it's like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode,? said Musk. This month Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (NYSE: SPCE) Chairman and SPAC King Chamath Palihapitiya warned investors against selling Tesla stock and said that Tesla is a disruptive company and not just an automaker. Palihapitiya said last year that Tesla was ?misvalued.? The former Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) executive said that Tesla could reach the scale of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has a market cap of over $2.3 trillion. Tesla reported Q4 2020 and full-year results on Wednesday. Revenue rose 46% year-over-year to $10.74 billion for Q4. Revenue for the full fiscal 2020 was $31.54 billion ? a rise of 28% year-over-year. Price Action: Tesla shares fell nearly 5% in the after-hours trading on Wednesday to $820.39 after closing 2.14% lower at $864.16.

The iPhone maker will roll out the new privacy features in early spring, with a beta version out sooner for testing. The new software update to its mobile OS would allow user ad tracking only if consumers opt-in. This means that companies like Facebook, Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet Inc?s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Google, and others would not be able to collect a person?s advertising identifier without permission. Tim Cook is due to speak at the Computers, Privacy, and Data Protection conference on Thursday on data privacy. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg in his fourth-quarter earnings conference call, said that Apple is one of its biggest competitors. ?iMessage is a key linchpin of their ecosystem,? remarked Zuckerberg. ?It comes pre-installed on every iPhone and they preference it with private APIs and permissions, which is why iMessage is the most used messaging service in the U.S.? Apple?s move has the app industry worried that opt-in requirements might lead many users to reject the request, resulting in the collapse of ad prices. Price Action: In the pre-market session on the last check Thursday, AAPL shares are down 2.24% at $138.88, and FB shares are down 0.57% at $270.60.

(NASDAQ: FB) shares ticked slightly higher Thursday after the company reported impressive fourth-quarter earnings numbers. Facebook reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.88, beating consensus analyst estimates of $3.22. Revenue of $28 billion also topped analyst expectations of $26.44 billion and represented 31% year-over-year growth. Facebook also reported average revenue per user of $10.14, beating analyst estimates of $9.49. Facebook?s daily active users climbed to 1.84 billion despite losing 1 million DAUs in the U.S. and Canada. Unfortunately, Facebook also warned its investors that upcoming changes to the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iOS 14 and economic reopening trends could weigh on the company?s advertising growth in 2021.

Post wrote in a note. View more earnings on FB Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said he's projecting 17% revenue growth in 2022 as Facebook?s long-term growth story continues. ?We believe valuation is attractive at ~26x our 2022E GAAP EPS (24.5x ex cash) vs. 15-20% LT EPS growth,? Kessler wrote. KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson said Facebook?s 2021 investments are likely planting the seeds for the company?s next growth phase. ?Historically, investment years have elongated FB's revenue growth and delivered meaningful EPS, and we believe this phase is no different,? Patterson wrote. Other Revenue Soaring: Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said Facebook?s roughly $400 million in Other Revenue may be more important than it seems at first glance. ?This is an early sign of budding success within FB?s virtual reality efforts (Oculus Quest 2)...which are important to FB?s long-term efforts to expand their user ecosystem and build the next generation computing platform,? Nowak wrote. Needham analyst Laura Martin said Apple?s changes could be bad news for Facebook investors. ?As soon as iPhone owners can opt out of advertising via the new iOS 14 permissions, they will,? Martin wrote. Ratings And Price Targets: Bank of America has a Buy rating and $358 target. Raymond James has a Strong Buy rating and $360 target. Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and $345 target. Needham has a Hold rating. KeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $360 target. Facebook's stock trades around $272.82 at publication time.

The Apple Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty maintained an Overweight rating on Apple and increased the price target from $152 to $164. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and $175 price target. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated an Outperform rating and increased the price target from $150 to $160. Needham analyst Laura Martin maintained a Buy rating and hiked the price target from $140 to $170. Why Apple Could Be Set For Double-Digit Growth: The combination of larger installed base, fully refreshed product portfolio and continued working and learning from home trends suggest Apple is on track to report strong double-digit growth over the next several quarters, Morgan Stanley's Huberty said in a note. The iPhone's strength, especially in China, and across-the-board Services upside contributed most of the beat, and gross margin expanded about two points, the analyst said. Although Apple did not provide formal revenue guidance, it said it expects normal seasonal trends, suggesting revenue of about $76 billion to $78 billion, she said. This is about $3 billion ahead of the consensus, Huberty said. The active device installed base growth accelerated from 7% a year ago to 10% and services monetization grew at the fastest rate in several years, the analyst said. Customer loyalty remains well north of 90% across Apple products, she said. Morgan Stanley now estimates 2020-2025 revenue CAGR of 10%, thanks to accelerating installed base growth, improved services monetization and a recovery in China. Higher gross margins are sustainable given growing FX tailwinds and a continued mix uplift across products, Huberty said. "Net, we raise our forward revenue and margin estimates with FY21 EPS increasing 6% to $4.47 and FY22 EPS increasing 8% to $4.61, both materially above consensus." Related Link: Apple Analyst: Cupertino's EV Ambitions Could Play Out With Partnership With Tesla, Chinese EV Brands Wedbush Mulls On Apple's ?Jaw Dropper' Q1: Revenue from the iPhone came in well above even the most bullish whisper numbers, Wedbush's Ives said in a note. View more earnings on AAPL Going by the 57% year-over-year growth in China, the reality has even exceeded the hype, the analyst said. "iPhone 12 success out of the gates was ?Usain Bolt-like' and is clearly on a path to meet the supercycle hype with iPhone units that could easily eclipse the previous Cupertino record from FY15 of 231 million units." The all-important Services business continues to fire on all cylinders and remains key to the re-rating in shares, he said. Raymond James Says Apple Delivered On All Fronts: Despite the late launch of iPhone 12, more revenue was delivered in the December quarter versus what is estimated for the March quarter, Caso said in a note. The analyst estimates that unit volume reached about 73 million, with an ASP approaching $900, the analyst said. The total of December plus implied March guidance is 4% above RayJay's numbers and 7% more than consensus, he said. Cupertino delivered on all fronts, including iPhone, Macs, wearables and Services, Caso said. "While Apple delivered on this cycle, we've long considered this to be a 2-year 5G cycle, with better global 5G coverage providing greater incentive for upgrades, along with what we expect to be a new form factor." Raymond James expects services to benefit from improving unit volume, which is adding to the installed base, along with new service offerings. Installed Base Growth Increases Needham's Optimism: Apple should be valued as an ecosystem company owing to its seamless integration of hardware, software and content, Needham analyst Martin said. A key lead indicator to Apple's upside value are the 1 billion unique iPhone users owning 1.65 billion active devices at the end of 2020, the analyst said. Deeper penetration of devices per home, she said, lowers churn and raises life time value, or LTV, per user. Services adds high-margin incremental revenues to LTV, and also lower churn, Martin said.

2021-01-28 15:09:37 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-28 15:09:37 and 2021-01-28 16:46:35+00:00: It seems like investors have plenty to mull over this morning, given the crazy action around apparent short squeezes, sobering comments about the economic recovery from the Federal Reserve, lofty stock valuations, and mixed economic news. The government?s first estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product came in under expectations, showing a 4% annualized gain when a Briefing.com consensus had forecast a rise of 4.4%. But weekly jobless claims data, a more up-to-date measure of economic health than the backwards-looking GDP print, came in better than expected, with initial claims coming in at 847,000 compared to 875,000 forecast in a Briefing.com consensus. Although the jobless data was better than expected, it still shows a very high number of people out of work. Investors have been getting increasingly jumpy about the economy amid an uneven vaccine rollout, and the overall state of worry seems to have worsened in recent days as concerns have grown about speculative trading, spilling over into losses overseas. With the disruption going on in the market right now related to apparent short squeezes, some investors may be taking profits on long positions to pay for losses in short positions, essentially selling winners to pay for losers and helping cause a readjustment of capital. At times like these, if you?re reassessing your own portfolio, it may be a good time to keep trades on the smaller side. Earnings Roundup Turning to earnings, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) opened its books on a blowout quarter yesterday after the closing bell. The tech giant?s quarterly revenue moved above $100 billion for the first time on double-digit sales increases in all of its business categories, and earnings came in handily above analyst expectations. Notably, iPhone sales rebounded on the back of interest in the new iPhone 12 models. They had slumped the previous quarter as people waited for the new smartphones to come out. Despite the amazing results, AAPL shares were down more than 2% this morning. It seems likely that this is a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news sort of situation, and investors may be taking some profits from AAPL?s run up in days prior to the earnings release. Turning to another tech-related company, Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) shares were faring a bit better?near the flat line in the early going?after the social media company reported better-than-expected sales and profit. At the same time, the company said that a moderation or reversal in the pandemic-accelerated shift toward online shopping and goods could negatively impact advertising revenue, as could privacy changes in AAPL?s mobile operating system. It seems this outlook is playing tug of war with the better-than-expected quarterly results to keep FB shares relatively flat this morning. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is another big tech-related company that reported quarterly results after the bell. Its shares were down more than 5% this morning despite the electric vehicle maker?s revenue coming in ahead of expectations. Although TSLA had another profitable quarter, it?s earnings came in well under analyst expectations. Plus, when you consider the incredible run recently in TSLA shares, it might not be unexpected to see a little froth come off the top. Wall Street Worry Ratchets Up Risk sentiment took a hit on Wednesday amid cautious words from the Fed and apparent institutional selling associated with retail investor-sparked short squeezes. Wall Street?s main fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) shot more than 60% higher to close at 37.21, its loftiest point since early November. With equities under pressure, investors moved into the relative safety of U.S. government debt, pressuring yields. A prolonged stay above 30 in the VIX could present a possible crossroads for investors, potentially drawing more sellers into stocks. A nearly 4% loss in Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) shares didn?t help market sentiment either. The aircraft manufacturer?facing delays in its 777X program amid engineering setbacks, the coronavirus travel slump, and extra scrutiny after the deadly 737 Max crashes?reported a record yearly loss and took a $6.5 billion charge in the most recent quarter. Although BA?s revenue was slightly better than analysts had expected, its per share loss was much larger than analysts had forecast. Recovery Seen Taking Time Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting press conference that it would be a long road to economic recovery, and that appeared to add to late selling pressure on Wall Street. There had been this belief that a vaccine would be a magic potion that would sort of pick everything up, but Powell put things in more realistic terms. It takes a while to recover, and that?s why rates remain unchanged and the Fed?s bond-buying program continues. In Powell?s press conference after the meeting, he said the central bank took the word ?medium-term? out of its policy language because the issues the economy faces like vaccinations and new cases are all happening now. The words ?medium term,? he said, are more a description of what he called ?long-term scarring? to the economy. The Fed said that the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, as it?s said in the past, but added the new phrase ?including progress on vaccinations.? A Fine Line Fed Chairman Jerome Powell continues to walk a tightrope, balancing monetary accommodation as the pandemic lingers, but also keeping in mind the added debt load. The pandemic goes on, and now reports of a variant virus that may be more contagious are complicating the return to any kind of ?normal? we were accustomed to before the outbreak. This economic cloud of uncertainty continues even as arms get vaccination jabs. There are no guarantees enough people will get injections to bring us to a herd vaccination level. And who?s to say what variant viruses might bring? And the economic impact? Sure, people are spending money, but consumer confidence is still hazy, rising modestly this month after a December dip. The gain in the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index to 89.3 from 87.1 in this week?s report was mostly attributed to the government?s pandemic relief checks sent out in late December. That?s a pattern repeating what happened after last year?s first round of stimulus checks. ?The slow rollout of the vaccines and the still-raging pandemic continue to depress consumer confidence despite the prospect of further fiscal aid and a brighter health situation,? Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York, said of the Conference Board report. Adding more grist is the weaker outlook for the job market after 900,000-plus jobless claims were made in the first week of January alone. CHART OF THE DAY: The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) shot higher Wednesday as worry mounted about certain speculative trading as well as cautious words about the economic recovery from the Fed. Although one day doesn?t make a trend, the extra unease is coming amid questions about high market valuations and perhaps a more sober look at the vaccine rollout. Data source: Cboe Global Markets.

Vocabulary of the Day: A lot of attention has been paid to GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) as apparent ?short squeezes? have contributed to massive gains for the stocks in a short time. But what exactly is a classic short squeeze? When an investor wants the ability to make money if a stock falls in value, they can borrow shares and then sell them. If shares fall as expected, the shorter can buy them back at the lower price, return them to the brokerage they borrowed from and count the difference (minus any interest on the borrowed shares) as profit. The problem comes when shares rise on unexpected bullish news, or as the case appears to be with GME and AMC, unexpected speculation. In that scenario, investors who are short a

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel. On some occasions, a good earnings report doesn't translate into a rally for a stock. With that being said, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day. Great Week Ahead Of The Report: Apple had one of its best weeks last week and the momentum carried over into Monday?s session. The issue ended the Jan. 15 session at $127.14 and ended last Friday?s session at $139.07. The rally continued on Monday, taking Apple to a new all-time high at $145.09. It was unable to reach that level on Tuesday but did post its all-time closing high on that day at $143.06. Double-Top And Some Profit-Taking: On Wednesday and Thursday, Apple put in a pair of highs ($144.30) and had a mild retreat. Considering the beating the S&P 500 index took on Wednesday, the retreat was minor in comparison. Whereas the index sank 2.6%, Apple was lower by only be less than 1%, falling from $143.16 to $142.06. View more earnings on AAPL What Is Not To Like? After the close on Wednesday, the company reported quarterly earnings of $1.68 per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.41 by 19.15%. The company reported quarterly sales of $111.40 billion, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $103.28 billion by 7.86%. Also, Mac, iPad, wearable devices and services all improved significantly over the same quarter last year. Price Action: As expected off the stellar report, the issue caught a bid in the after-hours session. However, sellers emerged en masse when the issue was surpassing its all-time closing high ($143.16), when it peaked at $143.61 and reversed course. It ended after-hours trading just off the low for the session ($136.50) at $137.43. In the regular session as of 12:10 p.m. ET, the issue has traded in just over a $2 range ($138 to $140.34) and is lower by $2 at $140.06.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) are facing antitrust investigations by regulators, the CEOs of the companies are trading barbs, heating up a years-long tension between the two tech CEOs. Facebook On Apple: On Thursday it was reported that Facebook is closer to filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple. Facebook accuses Apple of forcing its developers to follow rules pertaining to advertising on the App Store that Apple itself doesn?t follow. The suit could also cover Facebook?s frustration that Apple users must use Apple?s iMessage as the default messaging service instead of other services such as WhatsApp. In Facebook?s third-quarter conference call on Wednesday Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg railed against Apple?s iMessage for storing ?non-end-to-end encrypted backups of your messages by default unless you disable iCloud." Zuckerberg went on to tout WhatsApp for its security features, which he says make it ?far superior.? Apple On Facebook: Speaking at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference on Thursday Apple CEO Tim Cook attacked social media platforms for allowing the sharing of ?conspiracy theories and violent incitement simply because of their high rates of engagement.? Although he didn?t name Facebook specifically, he went on to accuse social media platforms of allowing anti-vaccination conspiracies to spread as well as for allowing extremist groups to use the platforms to incite violence. What?s Next: The two tech giants clearly have very different views on how data and information should be handled on the internet. Facebook prefers a more open and less regulated approach, whereas Apple believes that social media platforms have to take responsibility for the information its users have available to them. If the past is any prediction of the future, however, this battle doesn?t look as though it will end any time soon. Apple CEO Tim Cook. Courtesy photo.

What Happened: The Robinhood app was blasted with nearly 100,000 negative reviews on Thursday. The total number of reviewers stood at over 274,000 at the time. The app?s rating fell down to one star due to the review bombing, while the app previously enjoyed a four-star rating, 9to5Google reported. The rating has since gone back up to four stars after enough reviews were deleted by Google. As of press time, the App was rated by 177,501 reviewers. Robinhood on Thursday prevented its users from entering new positions in the shares of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), and others. Why It Matters: Participants in the Reddit forum that have fed the short squeeze frenzy of late in the shares of GameStop Corp, AMC, Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: BB), Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK), and others called for tanking the app?s ratings at Apple Inc?s (NASDAQ: AAPL) App Store and Google Play, according to a post on r/WallStreetBets. Do your part, tank Robinhood?s rating in the App / Google play Store. They deserve it. from r/wallstreetbets Google policies prohibit reviews that are misleading or are posted with the intention of manipulating the rating. See Also: Elon Musk Says Discord Gone 'Corpo' After It Takes Down WallStreetBets On the Apple App Store, Robinhood still has a 4.7-star rating. 9to5 Google reported that Apple potentially blocked the review bombs from affecting the overall score.

What Happened? On this day in 1997, the U.S. Treasury introduced the first Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Where Was The Market? The S&P 500 was trading at 772.50 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 6740.74. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 1997, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company, and the Mars Pathfinder successfully landed on the surface of Mars. A pound of hamburger meat cost $1.38. Bond Investors Get Inflation Hedge: After years of having to battle inflation when buying Treasury bonds, investors got their first crack at TIPS investing in 1997. While the coupon rates of TIPS are constant, the principals are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, a commonly used metric for measuring inflation. Treasury bonds are considered some of the lowest-risk investments out there due to their backing by the U.S. government. TIPS eliminate even more of the risk involved in Treasury bond investing. This lower risk comes at a price, however, as TIPS typically carry interest rates that are lower than other government or corporate bonds. Investors can buy TIPS for as little as $100 using the TreasuryDirect system. TIPS pay interest semiannually and are currently offered with maturities of five years, 10 years and 30 years. For investors who would prefer to buy TIPS ETFs, popular choices include the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund (ETF) (NYSE: TIP), the Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund (NASDAQ: VTIP) and the Schwab Strategic Trust (NYSE: SCHP).

At the moment it seems like there is a little bit of turnover in the market, with people trying to determine how all this will shake out. In the meantime, with volatility already heightened, investors may want to be on the lookout for even more volatility because of options expiration. While the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) did ease yesterday, it still closed above 30, and this morning is up roughly 14%. Still, the selling in equities this morning isn?t as pronounced as it was earlier in the week. Even though the VIX is higher along with gold, which is widely considered a safe-haven investment in turbulent times, oil is higher and so is the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The lower demand for U.S. government debt and increased willingness to buy a riskier asset like oil suggests that there is underlying support for the market once the hubbub about short squeezes dies down. Turning to coronavirus-related developments, vaccine news has been mixed. Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX) said its vaccine showed more than 89% effectiveness, while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) said its COVID-19 single-shot vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial but showed 85% efficacy against severe disease. The vaccine was 72% effective against moderate and severe disease in the United States, the company said. The Food and Drug Administration has indicated it would authorize a vaccine that?s safe and at least 50% effective. That?s a mouthful, but the main takeaway is JNJ?s vaccine looks less effective than vaccines already out there. The question is how viable it is as another vaccine when others have more than 90% effectiveness. Will people be OK taking one that?s below that? It remains to be seen, though JNJ is putting a positive spin on the results and some analysts pointed out that 66% effectiveness is better than the flu vaccine. Adjusting The Dial Noise. There?s a lot of it in the market these days. But as investors tune in to other aspects of the market besides heightened speculation in certain stocks, it seems they?re hearing things they like. For one thing, the earning season is generally going better than expected, raising hopes about the economic recovery. (See more on earnings below today?s chart.) In some of the latest mega cap earnings news, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) hit the cover off the ball as its quarterly revenue surpassed $100 billion for the first time. Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), another FAANG member, also reported better-than-expected sales and profit. American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL), which has been beaten up amid the coronavirus-related travel slump, also surprised to the upside, posting a smaller-than-expected loss on revenue that beat forecasts. Visa Inc (NYSE: V), which reported after the close Thursday, also beat on top and bottom lines. The strong start to earnings season comes as investors still retain optimism about the economic recovery despite a slow and uneven vaccine rollout. Although the government?s first crack at GDP showed the annualized figure for Q4 coming in under expectations, it still showed a 4% gain. Investors and traders apparently thought that was a decent-enough showing that they didn?t feel the need for stocks to sell off on the data. Meanwhile, initial weekly jobless claims figures decreased for the second week in a row, perhaps stoking some hope that the numbers might keep coming down as vaccinations become more widespread. Plus, with economic data improving but also showing we?re not out of the woods yet, it seems likely that investors and traders have been reminded for another time this week that the Fed?s easy monetary policy is likely to continue for some time. Next Week?s Earnings, Economic Data Next week, earnings season rolls on with high profile reports from companies including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA). Results from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) earlier this week were pretty stellar as growth in its Azure public cloud computing business increased for the third quarter in a row. With AMZN, GOOGL, and BABA all involved in the cloud computing space, it could be interesting to see if cloud computing demand for them also surprises to the upside. The economic calendar next week includes manufacturing and service-sector numbers, construction spending data, and figures on factory orders. The weekly jobless claims report on Thursday will probably again be closely watched as a barometer of the health of the economy during the pandemic. And the big data of the week comes on Friday in the form of the government?s non-farm payrolls report. CHART OF THE DAY: TREASURY BOUNCE. As you might expect on a day when Wall Street fears were easing and stocks were in the green, demand for the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell and the yield increased. It?s also interesting to note that the yield has bounced from a low just above 1% as seen in the 10-year Treasury Index (TNX?candlestick). That seems to be an important psychological number as interest rates remain low. Data source: Cboe Global Markets. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Earnings Beats: Investors seem to be generally encouraged as this earnings season turns out better than expected. A Wednesday report from Zacks Investment Research said that more than 83% of the 114 S&P 500 Index (SPX) companies that had reported by then had beaten earnings-per-share estimates. More than 77% had beaten revenue estimates, the research company said. ?This is a notably better performance than we have seen from the same group of companies in the first three quarters of the year,? the note said. Another research firm, FactSet, said on Thursday that earnings beat rates remain elevated but have trended lower. It seems that trend might be worth watching, but for the moment investors seem generally pleased with this earnings season. Cautiously Optimistic: In a bit of good news on the economic recovery front, the International Monetary Fund this week upwardly revised its outlook for 2021 global economic growth by 0.3 percentage points to 5.5%. The IMF said it expects a vaccine-powered strengthening later this year and additional policy support from a few large economies. But the IMF was also cautious in its outlook, saying that renewed waves and new variants of COVID-19 pose concerns. ?The strength of the recovery is projected to vary significantly across countries, depending on access to medical interventions, effectiveness of policy support, exposure to cross-country spillovers, and structural characteristics entering the crisis,? the IMF said. Carbon Trading: North America?s small regional carbon markets have been growing, even before news that the United States has begun the process of rejoining the Paris climate agreement. Expectations of policy changes that will result in tighter future carbon market balances helped the overall market value of the Western Climate Initiative and the Regional Greenhouse Initiative to grow by 16% in 2020 over 2019 levels, to roughly $26 billion and about $2 billion respectively, according to Refinitiv. Still, those markets are dwarfed by the European Emissions Trading System, which accounted for about 90% of the roughly $277 billion total value of the global carbon market in 2020.

The downside: You might be accused of having a monopoly on your hands and face a basket of antitrust lawsuits. That pretty much sums up Google?s parent company, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). After facing pandemic headwinds in Q2 of 2020 resulting in the company?s first-ever year-over-year quarterly revenue decline, GOOGL got back on its feet in Q3, crushing analyst expectations in just about every business segment. The road through Q4 looked promising, but then the search behemoth found itself broadsided with antitrust lawsuits from the Justice Department and 38 other states and territories. GOOGL?s ?monopoly? problem may arguably dampen investor sentiment. But let?s face it: the trial isn?t taking place until September 2023, and investor attention spans tend to fall on the short-term side of things. That means the focus might be more on GOOGL?s previous quarter and the ones ahead this year. Could all this be nothing more or less exciting than business as usual? We?ll find out when GOOGL reports Q4 earnings after the bell on Feb. 2. FIGURE 1: SECTOR TRACKING. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL?candlestick) have pretty much been moving in sync with the Communication Services sector ($IXC?purple line). It?ll be interesting to see how well the two correlate after GOOGL announces its Q4 earnings. Data source: Nasdaq, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. It?s Open Season For Online Ad Space The exciting news leading into the last quarter of 2020 was that search and YouTube ad revenues had bounced back in a big way during Q3. The drop in ad spending?nearly 80% of the company?s entire revenue?hit GOOGL like a ton of bricks in Q2 amid the lockdown. Even though people at home relied heavily on online search and streaming entertainment via YouTube?making ?online? the ideal stage for attention and engagement?many businesses were temporarily shuttered; most looking to cut expenses amid economic uncertainty. When you consider those challenges, the drop in ad spend was understandable. But if economic gloom prevented businesses from spending or doubling-down on their ad efforts, GOOGL?s Q3 ad revenue of $37.1 billion?jumping 10% year over year from Q2?s negative 8%?might have indicated early on that the space was, once again, about to be re-engaged. GOOGL may be the dominant player in search-based advertising and it may also hold a huge chunk of market share through its streaming YouTube platform. But the global share of online advertising, estimated at $389 billion in 2021 alone according to Statista, still presents a wide field of opportunity. In short, there?s lots of room for growth. And the time seems ripe to take the field, as vaccine rollouts and continued stimulus support encourage businesses to try to get back to business as usual. Did GOOGL take the opportunity to make a quick move on the renewed advertising season? That?s something investors will have to listen for when GOOGL opens its books. Plenty Of Room For Clouds In the Virtual Sky GOOGL is a huge company with a real penchant for disruption and innovation. But in the cloud space, it?s a small catcher-upper, trailing well behind leaders Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). To date, GOOGL?s cloud makes up only a little over 7% of its total revenue. But what matters most in GOOGL?s catch-up game isn?t the size of its cloud share but its growth rate. In Q3, its cloud revenue may have been up only $3.4 billion, small compared to AMZN?s $11.6 billion or MSFT?s $13 billion revenue for cloud. But if you take a look at the growth rate, GOOGL?s Q3 cloud revenue grew 45% year over year, as compared with AMZN?s 29% and MSFT?s 20%. GOOGL?s pursuit reminds us of a slogan (and book title) that captures the spirit of innovation in early tech, not unlike GOOGL in its early years: ?It?s not the big that eat the small ... it?s the fast that eat the slow.? Keep this in mind when GOOGL reports cloud revenues in the coming quarter, as Google Cloud, a segment CEO Sundar Pichai is aggressively driving, will be reported as its own stand-alone segment. Alphabet Earnings And Options Activity GOOGL is expected to report an adjusted EPS of $15.93, up from $15.35 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $53.1 billion, up 15.2% from a year ago. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 4.3% in either direction around the earnings release. Looking at the Feb. 5 options expiration, call activity has been spread out, but with a concentration at the 1900 strike. Put activity has also been spread out with the most active at the 1700 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 32nd percentile as of Friday morning. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. In ?Other? News ... GOOGL?s ?Other Bets,? its smaller projects and subsidiaries including Waymo, its driverless vehicle tech, and Verily Life Sciences brought in $178 million in Q3 revenue, nearly 15% more than a year earlier. However, it also generated a Q3 operating loss of $1.1 billion?up 17% from the same quarter the prior year. GOOGL also finalized its acquisition of electronic consumer and fitness company Fitbit a few weeks ago. Results of that acquisition will likely be reported in the quarter to come. Looking Ahead In Q3, GOOGL crushed analyst expectations, with earnings per share of $16.40 topping analyst estimates of $11.29, and revenue of $46.17 billion versus estimates of $42.90 billion according to research firm Refinitiv. Though analysts largely expect to see a year over year decline in Communications Services net profit margins, according to FactSet, analysts expect GOOGL to outperform its sector peers. Research firm CFRA noted the company?s dominance in search and streaming (YouTube) ad revenues as primary drivers. Though GOOGL CFO Ruth Porat withheld guidance for Q4, she emphasized the company?s continued investment in segments offering ?long-term sustainable financial value? particularly cloud growth. Will GOOGL offer any guidance this time out? It?s possible, but other Tech companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), decided not to, citing uncertainty around the pandemic.

Now it wasn?t as if there weren?t external reasons for the downturn. Between worries about slow vaccine rollout, weak European economic data, the appearance of the South African variant of the virus here, and a few disappointing earnings reports, it?s easy to find a fundamental story to blame. Still, it feels like the selloff, which accelerated Friday as the S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell nearly 2%, was more of a reaction to internal market developments. Anyone who?s paid attention knows about all the focus on short squeezes that brought fame (and some fortune) to stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC). There?ve been disruptions all over the world, and now the stock market is feeling some disruption and a change of tone. The short squeezes certainly had a lot to do with it. The way people interact with the market is a little different than in the past. There?s also a sense that things in general had come too far, too fast, sending values too high and leading to calls for a little consolidation. Basically, the four main stock indices had rolled along full steam ahead with hardly a break since early November, and that made some people nervous, especially about valuations. The short squeezes seemed to reinforce some investors? beliefs that it was time for a little profit-taking. It?s a storm of a lot of things coming together that?s leading to a disruption in the market overall. These kinds of disruptions occur every 10 or 12 years and the market has always survived them. People are reassessing their portfolios. Not just individuals, but funds, too. There?s a reassessment of value everywhere. Some of the major stocks leading the downward charge Friday included all the ?FAANGs? along with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)?which often has an outsized impact on the overall market due to its huge valuation?is down 8.5% since reaching an all-time high early this week. That?s despite a stellar earnings report. That?s the kind of thing that makes you wonder if we?re seeing some good old-fashioned profit-taking. From a sector standpoint, it looks like a few of the ones that had been doing best on the recent rally have fallen the hardest, including Energy, Info Tech, and Financials. The so-called ?defensive? sectors, including Utilities and Health Care, did best on Friday. Bumpy Ride Not Out Of The Ordinary It never feels good to lose money in the market, but it should feel familiar. Major indices generally experience several 5% drops each year and usually at least one 10% decline. The SPX hadn?t had any sort of serious backtracking since September when it fell around 9.6% from its highs. Then it went on a tear, chalking up gains of nearly 18% from the end of October up to its all-time highs earlier this month. Gains were even heavier for the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RUT), which entered this week trading at about 1.37 times its 200-day moving average, the highest it?s been relative to the 200-day since at least 2000. Hopes for further fiscal stimulus, the Fed?s dovish monetary policy (which it again promised this week to keep that way for the long term), and vaccine progress all helped electrify Wall Street between November and January. Now it feels like maybe things got a little ahead of themselves, considering all the challenges we still face. Europe is running low on vaccines. The U.S. rollout has been slower than expected. The Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) vaccine data today looked OK, but not amazing, and none of the vaccines seem to be as effective against this South African variant that has medical experts sounding nervous. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Q4 wasn?t quite as good as some people had hoped and moderated from the breakneck pace of Q3. Combine all that with earnings from Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) that didn?t blow anyone out of the water, cruise lines once again pushing back their schedules, a bond market that showed new life, rising volatility, and an SPX valuation at historic highs, and it would have been kind of weird not to have some weakness in stocks. Key Levels To Watch Include 30,000 In $DJI And 3700 In SPX Despite this disappointing end to the week, try to keep things in perspective. The SPX is still up 13.5% in the last three months, and remains around 3.5% below this month?s all-time highs. If a market correction is defined as a 10% decline from the high, we?re not even halfway there yet. That might feel reassuring in one sense, but it should also mean caution. There could be more weakness ahead if this downturn is going to become a correction, which can?t be ruled out. The argument against that is there just hasn?t been a lot of interest among investors to really push the market down over the last few months. Every time the SPX dropped to its 20-day moving average since Nov. 1, it met new buyers in what became called a ?buy the dip? trade. This week the SPX actually did fall below the 20-day and then tested the 50-day moving average, which was 3715 heading into Friday (see chart below). The question heading into next week is whether any technical support in that area holds, or if selling picks up. Longer-term technical support is in a range between 3633 and 3695, according to research firm CFRA. This is where the ?buy the dip? crowd meets a test: Will they still want to buy the dip after the main crunch of earnings season ends and the world continues to stumble trying to fight the pandemic? The two big numbers to watch could be 30,000 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) and 3700 in the SPX. The two indices flirted with those levels late Friday, and the $DJI ultimately closed just below 30,000. If it hops back above there Monday and manages to hold on, that would probably be seen as a technical victory that could promise a little recovery ahead. It?s kind of interesting that all this happened at a time when you could point to some actual positive developments in the background. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) both reported earnings that are about as solid as it gets and next week brings Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Other big names penciled into the earnings lineup next week include PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), and Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON). We?ll talk more about those reports and what to look for in them on Monday morning. As these companies report, stimulus traction appears to be growing on Capitol Hill. Media coverage this week suggested Democrats might try to speed the $1.9 trillion legislation through Congress through reconciliation, which wouldn?t necessarily require Republican votes. Whatever you might think of the legislation itself, stimulus generally appears to have helped the stock market over the last few months. Next week we?ll see if it elbows its way back into the headlines in a big way, which has potential to be a helpful force for the market. Volatility Explosion Could Keep Investors Cautious What?s not helpful is the way volatility just exploded this week. On one day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) skyrocketed to 37 from below 22. This isn?t something you often see, and overall the VIX had its biggest upside week since June. Historically, VIX?sometimes called the market?s ?fear index??trades in ranges over periods of time. It spent a lot of time last fall between 25 and 30, and then early this year between 20 and 25. Now it?s back above 30, and that could indicate more concern about possible choppiness and deeper losses straight ahead. One interesting thing now vs. a week ago, however, is that VIX futures have gone from contango (where outer months are higher than the current level) to backwardation, where the current level outweighs future prices. It was also positive to see the major indices bounce off of their lows late in Friday?s session, which could have po

The week's bullish calls included tech giants and an aerospace turnaround play. Electric vehicle and video streaming leaders were among the bearish calls seen. The three big U.S. indexes ended the week handily lower, led by the Nasdaq's more than 3% pullback. However, the Nasdaq still was up more than 5% for the first month of the year, while the Dow Jones industrials were only fractionally higher year to date and the S&P 500 landed in between them. It was quite a wild week on Wall Street, with social-media-driven extreme short squeezes that rapidly spread and left everyone from brokerages and regulators to renowned short sellers scrambling to respond. Tech giants took their turns in the earnings spotlight last week as well. Note though that not only were the world's two richest people at odds last week, but two other tech giant chiefs were as well. As Americans worried about the chaotic roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, a third vaccine seemed poised for launch, while another has ended up on the sidelines. Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged last week, and a big automaker said it plans to give up on gasoline-powered cars. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. Bulls "Apple Analysts Lift Price Targets Following 'Jaw Dropper' Q1: 4 Sell-Side Takes" by Shanthi Rexaline examines why Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be on track to report strong double-digit growth over the next several quarters as its businesses continue to fire on all cylinders. Priya Nigam's "Morgan Stanley Upgrades Boeing On Being 'Ready For Takeoff'" discusses how there are no significant incremental headwinds for Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) in 2021. See why a top analyst says it is "a COVID-19 recovery play with upside." Outperformance across every major product line highlights the strong secular positioning of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) as IT spending returns. So says Melanie Schaffer's "5 Microsoft Analysts Break Down Q2 Beat As More Organizations Shift To Cloud." In Jayson Derrick's "Is Now The Time To Buy Starbucks Stock? 6 Analysts Weigh In On Drop," see why analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) stock even though the company reported mixed quarterly results. For additional bullish calls of the past week, also have a look at the following: Why 2021 May See The Resurgence Of U.S. Industrials Will Restaurants Recover In 2021? Ray Dalio Clears His Stance On Bitcoin, Calls It 'Amazing Accomplishment' Bears Chris Katje's "Auto Margins, Production Unit Questions Remain After Tesla's Q4" shows that questions about valuation of and prospects for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) remain, despite strong delivery numbers for the latest quarter. In Neer Varshney's "Long-Term Netflix Bear Admits He Got These Key Things Wrong About The Company," find out why a prominent long-term Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLIX) bear says he was wrong about the company but remains bearish. Visa Inc (NYSE: V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) are likely to fall short on Wall Street expectations for cross-border revenue, according to "KeyBanc Downgrades Mastercard, Visa On Industry Trends" by Priya Nigam. Will domestic spending trends be enough? "Why Wells Fargo Is Waiting For Better DoorDash Entry Point" by Jayson Derrick makes the case that DoorDash Inc (NYSE: DASH) is now operating from a position of strength but the stock "looks expensive." When might investors find a more favorable entry point?

2021-01-31 01:10:59 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-31 01:10:59 and 2021-01-31 05:00:03+00:00: (Bloomberg) -- English Premier League soccer club Manchester City are well-known for spending big in their pursuit of trophies. Yet this winter?s key signing is not a new striker or a commanding defender, it?s a hedge fund veteran with a doctorate in astrophysics.Laurie Shaw?s r?sum? is straight from high-brow science and finance. He studied such things as dark matter halos and galaxy clusters at Cambridge and Yale universities before moving to data science at Harvard via London-based algorithmic investment firm Winton Capital Management and the U.K. Treasury. Then soccer came calling.While the marriage of sport and data in the pursuit of marginal gains is hardly new, Shaw?s move appears be the latest escalation in the battle among top teams for an edge in the world?s most lucrative competitions. It?s all the more striking because Manchester City is expected to close out the month-long transfer window for trading players on Feb. 1 without making any significant on-field additions.The 39-year-old Manchester native will lead AI Insights at parent company City Football Group. He will focus on building machine-based models to better manage player fatigue, injury and illness. His will also work on player identification, recruitment and individual development, pre and post-match analysis and recruitment of coaches.?More so than ever, the plan for the team off the pitch is arguably more critical to success than any other element,? said Trevor Watkins, global head of sport at Pinsent Masons, a law firm that recently advised on U.S. investment company ALK Capital?s acquisition of Premier League team Burnley.Shaw will work with the Manchester City group?s 11 clubs in five continents stretching from New York to Melbourne. He joins an expanding team that already includes a performance physicist.Last season, City lost out to rival Liverpool in the race for the Premier League championship after winning it four times since the takeover of the club by a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Al Nahyan, in 2008.Liverpool has also pushed heavily into data science, a strategy seen as contributing to its first league title in 30 years. Bookmakers currently make Manchester City favorite to prevail this season.Data-driven player investment has led to an ?arms race for PhD statistics and physics talent,? said Paul Conway, director of Pacific Media Group. The company owns second-tier English club Barnsley, where Billy Beane, the data science guru who inspired the book and film ?Moneyball,? is a director.?We fully expect in the next few seasons?like it?s embraced in baseball?that these PhDs will also be on the pitch, in uniform and computer in hand, advising coaches on real-time match decisions,? said Conway.Manchester City, which typically unveils new signings with a slick media campaign, played down Shaw?s arrival. The club declined a request for an interview and didn?t comment on the details of Shaw?s role.That?s not to say there?s no soccer pedigree, albeit from behind a computer screen. Shaw has been running a blog, called EightyFivePoints, dedicated to ?two things I spend a substantial amount of my time doing: analyzing data and following football.? He gets editing help from his brother?a Liverpool fan.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

He and other individual investors hold parts of PIL?s S$60 million security ($45 million) that came due in November but which the shipper hasn?t repaid.Kuah had initially felt relief last year when he heard that the Temasek unit was providing a $600 million package comprising debt and equity to PIL. But he said he became worried when he saw the company?s restructuring plan. Under the so-called scheme of arrangement, it could be at least five years before unsecured noteholders saw actual cash payments, according to presentation materials.In contrast, some secured lenders like banks could get payments for their claims subject to the company having sufficient excess cash. PIL said in May last year it received an in-principle approval from a majority of its financial lenders, constituting 97.6% of the company?s total debt, for ?a formalized standstill on enforcement actions? until a debt re-profiling pact is agreed on.?For us to be left out until the very end should not be the way that things are done,? Kuah said.Watch a Bloomberg Daybreak video on shipping industry outlooks in 2021PIL told Bloomberg News it had been transparent and open to hearing from noteholders. It has held two informal meetings for the bondholders, and 16 small-group dialog sessions. It?s also attended to more than 100 emails and calls and hired a lawyer to give noteholders advice.?We believe the comprehensive financing and restructuring plan presented in the scheme of arrangement represents the best path forward for all stakeholders,? the company said in an email. ?PIL has received the support of a significant majority of creditors for the scheme, and is confident that the required approval thresholds can be met.?Unhappy with the restructuring plan, Kuah protested to the Singapore courts. And earlier in January, a court ruled that the company classify all its fully unsecured creditors as a separate group in the Monday vote, potentially giving them power to block the deal. Under Singapore law, at least half the investors holding over 75% of value in each creditor class present for the vote must approve the deal for it to be successful, unless the court decides otherwise.But blocking the deal won?t be easy: opponents would need to convince enough bondholders to vote against it, with some who may be worried that a canceled bailout would result in even worse terms. The shipping company has said cancellation would lead to them getting just 2 cents for every dollar in claims through a liquidation process. And the court could overrule the vote.Still, it?s a sign that with global corporate defaults forecast to peak in coming months due to the economic slump caused by the pandemic, individual investors may become more vocal in seeking to be repaid. In Singapore?s case, the stakes for such investors have already been highlighted by the plight of over 34,000 mom and pop investors in Hyflux Ltd. still waiting to see if they will recover any money more than 2-1/2 years after the start of a court-supervised restructuring process.Under the terms of PIL?s restructuring plan, each holder of unsecured notes would pick one of two options. Their claims will be replaced with perpetual securities that have no maturity date, and they could either get $1 of perps for every dollar of claim that would only start paying cash after six years, or they could receive $1 of perps for every $2 of claims that would start cash distribution after five years.Apart from the bondholders, the voting class of unsecured creditors also includes six facility lenders: SC Lowy; Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.; Chinatrust Commercial Bank Co.; KBC Bank NV; E.SUN Commercial Bank Ltd., Singapore Branch; and United Oversea Bank Ltd. They have claims totaling nearly $124 million, according to a Dec. 15 explanatory note that the company sent to all creditors seen by Bloomberg News.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Despite the 4Q beat, its shares closed 3.7% lower on Friday. Honeywell?s (HON) 4Q earnings of $2.07 per share remained flat year-over-year but topped the company?s guidance range of $1.97-$2.02 per share as well as analysts? expectations of $2.00. Its revenues of $8.9 billion declined 6% year-over-year but came in above the Street?s forecasts of $8.4 billion. Organic revenues decreased by 7% during the quarter, reflecting weakness across most of its business segments. However, organic sales for its Safety and Productivity Solutions segment jumped 27% in 4Q. The company?s CEO Darius Adamczyk said, ?Honeywell's strong balance sheet put us in a good position to weather the challenges of 2020 while investing for future growth. We invested in high-return capital expenditures, repurchased $3.7 billion of Honeywell shares, completed three acquisitions, made six new investments within Honeywell Ventures, and announced our 11th consecutive dividend increase.? As for 2021, the company expects to generate revenues of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion versus analysts? expectations of $33.95 billion. It projects an organic revenue growth range of about 1% to 4% for 2021. Furthermore, Honeywell forecasts adjusted earnings to be in the range of $7.60 to $8.00 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 7% to 13%. Analysts were looking for earnings of $7.87 per share. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks) On Jan. 29, Cowen & Co. analyst Gautam Khanna maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $225 (15.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said, ?Q4 adj EPS beat due to stronger sales in all segments, and margin impressed at Aero where aero aftermarket rose 26% vs. Q3.? Overall, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys and 8 Holds. The average analyst price target of $210.19 implies upside potential of about 7.6% to current levels. Shares gained 13.9% in the past year.

Pretax income will be ?moderately higher? than in 2020, while capital expenditure will be similar, Sabic said in a results statement.Sabic earned net income of 40 million riyals ($10.7 million) in 2020, down sharply from 5.2 billion riyals in 2019. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a loss of almost 300 million riyals after the pandemic caused demand for chemicals products to sink.Sabic?s net income between October and December was 2.2 billion riyals, more than double the figure for the third quarter.?The fourth quarter benefited from sustained economic recovery,? said Chief Executive Officer Yousef Al-Benyan. ?Distributing competitive dividends to our shareholders continues to be paramount and this is supported by our firm commitment to maintaining capital discipline, as well as our ability to uphold a strong balance sheet and credit rating.?In December, the company?s board announced a dividend of 1.5 riyals per share for the second half of 2020, unchanged from the first half.Sabic?s stock fell 0.4% to 102.20 riyals in early trading on Sunday. It?s risen 0.8% this year and is up 65% since its trough in March, during the first wave of the virus, of 62 riyals.Aramco bought 70% of Sabic last year from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund for $69 billion. The takeover will result in as much as $1.8 billion of ?annual value creation and synergy? by 2025, Sabic said.The company is seeking to list its specialty unit through an initial public offering and has has shortlisted banks including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley for roles on the deal, Bloomberg reported this month.The unit generates about $2 billion of revenue annually. Its establishment as a standalone entity last year was a ?major milestone that should support the company?s ambitions to be a leader in the specialty chemicals industry,?

According to a company filing dated Jan. 26, the Board of Directors approved an annual salary of $20.3 million for 2020, compared to a salary of $23 million in 2019. This reflects a decline of around 12% year-on-year. The company filing cites its weak 4Q results as one of the reasons for the lower compensation. Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO Scharf?s annual compensation for 2020 included a base salary of $2.5 million, annual incentive compensation of $4.4 million payable in cash and long-term incentive compensation of $13.5 million. The long-term incentive amount will be split between performance shares and restricted share rights. A restricted share right is the right to receive shares of Wells Fargo at a future date, provided certain vesting requirements for the shares and other conditions are satisfied. Earlier this month, the banking giant reported 4Q revenues of $17.9 billion, representing a drop of 10.8% year-on-year. Revenues in 4Q also fell short of analysts? expectations of $18.1 billion. The lower revenues highlighted declines across all of its business segments. The company?s bottom-line result, however, marked a 6.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter?s earnings of $0.60 per share, reflecting lower noninterest expenses. (See Wells Fargo stock analysis on TipRanks) On Jan. 25, Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and raised the price target from $35 to $40. Katzke said in a research note about the company?s 4Q results, ?To be sure, the path forward has its obstacles and revenue growth remains a challenge, but the combination of evident progress, incremental investment, excess capital and the inherent franchise opportunity reduce the downside risk and render the aspiration of a 15% ROTE [return on tangible equity] achievable, in time.? The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That?s based on 12 analysts recommending a Buy and 5 analysts suggesting a Hold. The average analyst price target of $36.00 implies a 20.5% upside potential to current levels. News Sentiment for Wells Fargo is Neutral based on 33 articles over the past seven days.

In response, the energy giant?s shares closed 4.3% lower on Friday.

The company?s revenues of $25.3 billion missed the Street estimates of $26.2 billion and declined 30.5% year-over-year. Chevron added 832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2020, which mainly came from the acquisition of Noble Energy and from assets in Kazakhstan. Chevron said, ?These additions, which are subject to final reviews, are net of reductions associated with lower commodity prices, decisions to reduce capital funding for various projects and asset sales.? Chevron?s CEO Mike Wirth noted, ?2020 was a year like no other.? He added, ?When market conditions deteriorated, we swiftly reduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019 and also reduced operating costs, demonstrating our commitment to capital and cost discipline.? (See Chevron stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the results, Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $112 (25.8% upside potential) on the stock, ?based on a more secure balance sheet, solid leverage to a macro/oil price recovery and capital allocation that is already aligned with investor preferences.? In a note to investors, Jenkins wrote, ?Efficiency drivers are set to improve profitability into 2021, while a 'block and tackle' capital program over the next few years should further improve competitiveness, even without more help from the macro environment.? Meanwhile, the rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst price target of $104.15 implies upside potential of about 22.2% to current levels. Shares were down about 19% in the previous year.

The judge dismissed the fraud claims regarding the alleged misrepresentations of General Electric?s (GE) insurance portfolio and service agreements but allowed the shareholders to continue pursuing other claims, including certain allegations against former Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey Bornstein. General Electric paid a $200 million civil penalty in December in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission?s (SEC) allegations that it misled investors about its insurance and power businesses. In an SEC filing, GE neither admitted nor denied the allegations but concluded that it was in the best interest of GE and its shareholders to ?resolve this matter and put it behind us.? Reuters reports that lawyers for the plaintiffs asked the judge to treat the settlement as an admission of guilt and as proof that GE had misled them. Judge Furman rejected this suggestion. (See General Electric stock analysis on TipRanks) Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell reiterated his Buy rating on GE last week and raised his price to $13 from $12. This implies upside potential of around 22% from current levels. Mitchell told investors he believes that GE shares are undervalued based on its Q4 performance and forward-looking guidance.

However, Mark Zuckerberg failed to persuade lawmakers to change the policy, according to Reuters. The report also says that Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told Australian Broadcasting Corp, ?No, Mark Zuckerberg didn?t convince me to back down if that?s what you?re asking.? According to the proposed law, news media outlets can negotiate collectively or individually, over content that drives traffic to Facebook and Google?s websites. If these parties fail to reach an agreement, an arbitrator appointed by the Australian Government will set the fees for both parties. In view of this proposed law, earlier this month, Facebook had said that it will stop news sharing if the Australian government proceeds while Google threatened to withdraw its search engine from the country. Companies like Facebook are opposing this law as it would mean an increase in compliance costs and could also put a dent in its advertising revenues as the proposed law also states that companies will have to share their consumer data from such news content. Advertising is a major source of revenue for Facebook. (See Facebook stock analysis on TipRanks) In the fourth quarter, Facebook reported advertising revenues of $27.2 billion, up by 31% year-on-year. The advertising business made up about 96.8% of total revenues in 4Q for the company. Mark Zuckerberg also warned of the timing of ?platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape,? during Facebook?s 4Q results. William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart reiterated a Buy rating on the stock on Jan. 28. Commenting on the company?s 4Q results, Schackart noted, ?In the first half of 2021, Facebook will lap a period of growth that was negatively affected by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic. Thus, year-over year growth rates in total revenue are expected to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially during the first and second quarters of 2021.? ?In the second half of the year, Facebook will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which is expected to put significant pressure on year-over-year growth rates,? Schackart added. The rest of the Street is bullish about the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. That?s based on 35 analysts recommending a Buy, 3 analysts suggesting a Hold, and one analyst recommending a Sell. The average analyst price target of $341.28 implies a 32.1% upside potential to current levels.

Supplies of major commodity crops are dwindling worldwide as buyers hoard food supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic.  China is loading up on grains and oilseeds that it can feed to animals, raising food inflation and causing some nations to restrict exports of their crops.
2021-01-31 08:10:36 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-31 08:10:36 and 2021-01-31 12:00:00+00:00: (Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp.?s surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those bearish positions probably aren?t big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds.That?s the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market?s capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week?s selling -- the worst in the S&P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they?re unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.?We?re witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don?t have an outsize influence,? said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. ?The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up.?Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket shows.While the S&P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly. To JPMorgan Chase & Co.?s strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a ?short-lived technical tumble.? With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020?s pandemic market.?Although the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,? Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop?s ticker. ?While we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.?By Barclays?s tally, short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.?We remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,? Deshpande said. ?The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low.?For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Other featured articles offer Barron's Roundtable stock picks for 2021, examine how retail has changed over the past century and ponder what's ahead for the markets in February. Also, the prospects for an EV battery maker, infrastructure stocks, commodities and more. Cover story "The GameStop Revolt Has Just Begun" by Avi Salzman and Connor Smith discusses how a band of online renegades took the investing world by storm. Investors can ignore some of the silliness surrounding AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NYSE: BBBY), GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and others, says the article, but the market may never be the same. Lauren R. Rublin's "Roundtable: 22 Ways to Invest in the Future" features the favorite stock picks for 2021 from Barron's Roundtable members. See why those recommendations include Boston Beer Company Inc (NYSE: SAM), Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) and Prologis Inc (NYSE: PLD). In "Commodities Are Starting to Rally. Play It With These Stocks and Funds," Andrew Bary makes the case that energy, metals and agriculture are poised to gain as global economies reopen and inflation stirs. Time to take a look at Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) or Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM)? Lithium-ion battery maker Quantumscape Corp (NYSE: QS) has a pioneering battery technology. So says "EV Battery Start-Up QuantumScape Is Driven Solely by Promise" by Al Root. What it will not have for five years is much revenue, and yet the share price has risen well more than 300% since August. In Kenneth G. Pringle's "From Dry Goods to Dot-Coms, How Shopping Has Changed Over the Past Century," the focus is on how the arrival of nationwide chains and department stores in the early 1900s changed the nature of shopping in America and the landscape of its communities, much as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is doing now. "As GameStop and the Little Guys Soar, Big Tech Gets Forgotten" by Eric J. Savitz points out that earnings from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) confirmed their dominance. Still, market reaction suggests that there is some concern about these stocks.

In "Investors Who Own Blacklisted Chinese Stocks May Be in Limbo," Reshma Kapadia examines the options that smaller investors with American depositary receipts of blacklisted Chinese companies have as they try to divest their shares. Ben Levisohn's "It's Been a Rough January. Get Ready for an Even Worse February" says that this was supposed to be the Teflon stock market, able to absorb political turmoil, a resurgent virus and mediocre data to keep on rising.

2021-01-31 12:40:57 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-01-31 12:40:57 and 2021-01-31 14:28:40+00:00: Could you ever imagine a week in the markets when earnings reports from technology titans, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MFST), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) were secondary news? Or a Fed meeting? Welcome to bizarro world. This week in the markets was just that way ? and who knows how long it could continue? Fundamentals, Shundmentals: If the price action in the markets this week has proven anything, it is that fundamental analysis is dead for now. When the week concludes, the biggest winners are going to be GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC), and not companies that produced banner earnings reports that exceeded Wall Street?s expectations. Instead, the big winners will be stocks being pumped and dumped on message boards. Were some of these companies undervalued at the bargain prices they were trading at? Sure. On the other hand, are the heights these stocks reached this week representative of the companies' futures in the years to come? Who cares? Technical Analysis Steps Up To The Plate: In a world where fundamental analysis is no longer a valid way to evaluate the value of companies, traders and investors may turn to turn technical analysis. In fact, a large portion of the investing world already incorporates technical analysis into its decisions. When the other half of the formula is useless, this part of the formula becomes much more important. For example, did the parabolic rally in shares of Bed, Bath and Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY) stall out at $53.90 for no reason? Heck no. Back in early 2016, the issue had a pair of monthly highs at the $52.50 area. The bagholders in the issue ? who were stuck with a huge losing issue for years in the greatest bull market of all-time ? were getting bailed out. Does this necessarily mean that the stock is not going back to that high or $100, $200 or $500? No. But what you have now is a whole new set of bagholders who are waiting to get out. Since peaking at $53.90 on Wednesday, the issue traded down to $30.08 on Thursday and briefly traded over $40 in Friday?s session. How many investors are hoping it gets back to $50 for a scratch or to eke out a small profit? Broken Markets: Whether you believe it or not, the markets are broken for now. For those who cheer the demise of hedge funds and large trading institutions, be careful what you wish for. They are the ones that provide liquidity in the markets, and if you think they all are getting smoked now, you are mistaken. The real demon in the house is payment for order flow, which has enabled brokerage firms to offer free trading. These firms are still making money ? not from commissions, but by selling their order flow. The solution? There isn?t one. SEC inquiries and investigations may uncover a few of the culprits in the schemes, but the cat is out of the bag. To be clear, this is not new. For years, hedge funds have beat up on each other in the markets for gains. The only difference is that the power is with the masses, and some of these same tactics are being used on a large scale. We are already witnessing the devastating impact this is having on the markets. If it continues in this direction, all investors large and small will suffer in the end.

What Happened: Tenev said it had been a ?surreal? week for him, in a reference to the Reddit investor-led short squeeze rally in the shares of Gamestop Corp (NYSE: GME), Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: BB) and others. The brokerage head referred to these stocks as ?meme stocks? throughout the broadcast where he appeared to clarify the events of the tumultuous week ? when purchase of such stocks was restricted on the popular trading app. Tenev said the app experienced ?unprecedented volume? and ?load on the system.? He pointed out that the net buys increased exponentially. Robinhood was among the top apps on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc?s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) respective app stores as of last week, Tenev noted. Detailing the sequence of events that led to the suspension of buying in the Reddit-fueled stocks, he said Robinhood received a demand for $3 billion from the National Securities Clearing Corporation in the wee hours of Thursday. NSCC provides clearing, settlement, risk management, and central counterparty services. The executive explained that Robinhood had to put up money for the NSCC based volatility and the concentration of securities but the formula behind the demand was not fully known to him. Why It Matters: The NSCC is not a government agency but is rather controlled by a consortium, as per Tenev. The executive said that on Monday?s opening, some of the ?stringent limits? placed on the hot stocks will be removed. Tenev said that some limits would always be in place. ?If someone decided to deposit $100 billion and trade in one stock that?s not gonna be possible.? ?Citadel and other market makers were not involved in it,? said Tenet in reference to the trading restrictions. NSCC had lowered its deposit requirements to $1.4 billion after Robinhood reached out. After explanations were given on the restrictions, the clearinghouse dropped the deposit to $ 700 million. Tenev admitted that restricting trade was a ?bad outcome for customers? but other brokers had also placed similar restrictions. In a lighter moment in the interview, Musk asked Tenev if he was being held hostage while handing out this explanation, to which the Robinhood CEO replied in negation, saying ?thanks for asking.?

SEATTLE, Feb. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Changing parking behavior due to COVID-19 left parking lots empty all across the country. A.lot Parking, a provider of comprehensive one-stop shop parking technology solutions, is solving these challenges to make sure commercial real estate and parking owners are ready to grow their asset value as soon as the pandemic eases. It is becoming apparent that the office hours of commercial real estate tenants are not getting back to pre-COVID levels. Many employees already successfully adapted to shift work or a mix of home and on-site office hours.

A.lot Parking offers a solution ? the digital cloud-based system enables multiple ways to set dynamic pricing or to authorize and accommodate various parking needs of customers, employees, vendors and associates. The system provides high level of flexibility to the drivers as they can use a mobile app or a website platform to reserve parking spot when needed, open barriers and pay for parking. The operations and management of real estate assets such as parking during the pandemic have morphed into off-site or remote mode. The Parking Management Platform (PMP) by a.Lot powered by very precise license plate recognition (LPR) technology addresses this situation - no need to have any on-site personnel as all features including access control, payments and reservations are fully digitized, cloud-based, touchless and can be managed remotely. This typically results in significant operational cost reduction. Finally, a.Lot?s PMP precisely tracks real-time parking utilization and the freed-up parking spaces can be automatically released and accessed by additional drivers. A.Lot technology enables parking sharing with other business customers and is integrated with multiple third party parking reservations apps such as SpotHero. A.lot Parking enables the parking asset owners to not only reduce operational costs, but to substantially increase utilization of parking spaces, revenue and return on assets. There are the reasons why a.Lot technology and services are chosen by leading commercial real estate owners and managers such as Greystar, Alexandria and many others.

Potter wrote in a note to clients. The analyst maintained his buy-equivalent rating on the stock.After rising more than 8-fold in 2020, Tesla shares are up another 12% so far in 2021 after reporting strong delivery numbers for the fourth quarter. However, the shares pared some of its best gains after profit for the period disappointed and the company refrained from providing a specific delivery guidance for 2021. The stock was up 3% premarket Monday.While the surge in Tesla?s share price led investors to hunt for smaller EV players and startups, the sector has also benefited from a growing acceptance among analysts and others that electric cars will dominate the automotive industry, with governments around the world announcing policies to encourage the phasing out of gas-fueled cars.Potter expects Tesla to deliver 894,000 vehicles in 2021, eventually increasing to more than 9 million units in 2030, making it among the top-3 automakers globally. The analyst also expects to see a steady ramp up in the adoption of Tesla?s full self-driving (FSD) software starting in 2030, with more than half of all Tesla owners using the FSD package by the end of 2040.Other EV stocks were also rising premarket, including Nio Inc., Workhorse Group Inc., XPeng Inc., Lordstown Motors Corp., Li Auto Inc., Kandi Technologies Inc. and Fisker Inc. Earlier on Monday, Nio said it delivered 7,225 vehicles in January, up more than 350% from last year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 Bloomberg L.P.

This week we posed the following question to over 500 traders and investors as to whether Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) should acquire a popular streaming service: Over the next year, should Disney acquire Roku or Spotify? Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU) Spotify Technology SA (NYSE: SPOT) Both Neither Disney owns the rights to some of the most globally recognized characters, making live-action and animated films in studios such as Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. Disney also operates media networks including ESPN and several TV production studios. The company recently announced that its on-demand TV and movie streaming service Disney+ has reached 86.8 million subscribers. The Disney+ streaming service mobile app also gained 2.3 million global installations over the Christmas holiday, according to Sensor Tower, a market research firm. At time of publication, Disney?s market cap is in excess of $300 billion. Roku and Spotify?s market cap measure in at $49 and $59 billion, respectively. Twenty-eight percent of respondents told us Disney should acquire Roku by the end of 2021. Roku is becoming a household name and replacing cable boxes in homes, so an acquisition would immediately strengthen Disney?s market share in streaming, respondents said. Roku has focused on TV and film for its streaming services, while Spotify is predominantly music and podcasts. Given that Disney produces content predominantly in the realm of TV and film, respondents believe Disney would be better served moving forward with acquiring Roku. Next, 19% of respondents believe Disney should complete an M&A deal with Spotify by the end of the year. Spotify would bring music streaming services to Disney to compete with the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). Besides Apple, Spotify is the outright leader in audio, where Disney has no footprint. A Spotify M&A would immediately put Disney on the map in the music streaming industry. Meanwhile, 21% of traders and investors told us Disney should move forward with an M&A with both Roku and Spotify. Thirty-one percent of respondents felt Disney would be better off not moving forward on M&A in 2021 with Roku or Spotify. Among this group, many respondents stated they don't want more major, successful media companies under one roof. With ABC, ESPN and Marvel all under Disney?s ownership, there was concern among traders and investors that Disney is already moving towards monopoly status in the media industry and would be better served polishing and perfecting its current family of brands and services.

What Happened? On this day in 2016, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) briefly became the world?s largest public company. Where Was The Market? The S&P 500 was trading at 1,939.38 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 16,449.18. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 2016, 195 countries joined together to sign the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union via the Brexit referendum vote. In the U.S., in-state college tuition cost averaged $24,610. A Short Reign: In February 2016, Google?s parent company Alphabet briefly passed Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the world?s largest company by market cap. Alphabet?s stock jumped after the company reported better-than-expected earnings, but Apple regained its title only two days later. Apple expanded its lead over Google in 2017, gaining 42.6% on the year and finishing with a market cap of $868.8 billion compared to Alphabet?s $731.9 billion.

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $134.22. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-03-19 Strike Price: $135.00 Volume: 2946 Open Interest: 148338 Three Ways Options Activity Is ?Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. "Out of the money" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. "Out of the money" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are "bullish" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are "bearish" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-02-01 13:10:52 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-01 13:10:52 and 2021-02-01 14:48:56+00:00: Last week?s volatility and market disruption can take a long time to settle down, so strap in. The new month starts with Wall Street in an unfamiliar position: Down for the year. Friday?s selloff accelerated a turnaround that began earlier in the week, putting a red mark on the major indices? January performance. Heading into Monday, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) was down 1.1% so far in 2021, with the Nasdaq (COMP) off 1.4% and the previously high-flying Russell 2000 Index (RUT) down a sharp 5%. Keep things in perspective, though. The SPX is up about 66% from last year?s lows, and nothing can climb forever without a break. Despite all the wild action last week and so much uncertainty about what would happen?even with the inner workings of the market itself?the market rallied back overnight, and trading seems to be going normally this morning. There may be margin restrictions from some firms, but otherwise it looks like typical trading. Like Ringing A Bell: Volatility Not Necessarily Departing Some of last week?s turbulence and volatility survived the weekend into Sunday night and early Monday. If you were watching the futures market, maybe you noticed how the major indices were down sharply last night before reversing course and charging higher ahead of the opening bell. Usually when there?s trading like we saw last week, it doesn?t get right back to normal, so you probably shouldn?t expect that. Instead, this volatile trading is like a big bell ringing?the reverberations can last a while. More volatility is almost certainly ahead, along with the chance of some dramatic swings back and forth. Anyone planning on trading the market right now should consider taking extra caution and possibly keeping trade sizes smaller than normal. Volatility is slightly lower this morning but that won?t necessarily last. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is still well above 30, compared with the historic average near 20. There?s also a strange relationship going on early today with volatility down but bonds up. In addition, the bond market is on the rise even while stocks rallied an amazing amount from their lows overnight. There?s a disconnect between the bond and the equity market at the moment, so we?ll have to see what the outcome is. It?s not like the bond market is exactly flashing caution, but bonds and VIX being up reinforce the chance for volatile trading. It?s a big earnings week and we?ve got a lot of data coming, too, including Friday?s monthly jobs report. Two FAANGs?Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)?step up to the plate tomorrow afternoon. The hits keep coming. Then there?s the elephant in the room. Anyone paying any attention at all knows about the focus on short squeezes that brought fame (and some fortune) to stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC). There?ve been disruptions all over the world, and now the stock market is feeling some disruption and a change of tone. The short squeezes certainly had a lot to do with it. The way people interact with the market is a little different than in the past. There?s a storm of a lot of things coming together leading to a disruption in the market overall. These kinds of disruptions occur every 10 or 12 years and the market has always survived them. Despite the disappointing end to last week, try to keep things in perspective. The SPX is still up 13.5% in the last three months, and remains around 3.5% below this month?s all-time highs. If a market correction is defined as a 10% decline from the high, we?re not even halfway there yet. That might feel reassuring in one sense, but it should also mean caution. There could be more weakness ahead if this downturn is going to become a correction, which can?t be ruled out. The argument against that is there just hasn?t been a lot of interest among investors to really push the market down over the last few months. Every time the SPX dropped to its 20-day moving average since Nov. 1, it met new buyers in what became called a ?buy the dip? trade. Last week the SPX actually did fall below the 20-day and then ended slightly below the 50-day moving average near 3716 (see chart below). The question heading into this week is whether any technical support in that area holds, or if selling picks up. Earnings Parade Still Gathering Steam It?s kind of interesting that all this happened at a time when you could point to some actual positive developments in the background. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) both reported earnings that are about as solid as it gets and this week brings Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Other big names penciled into the earnings lineup this week include PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), and Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON). The PTON report could be interesting for insight on how the company plans to handle things once people get back to normal following the pandemic. PTON has done well with everyone stuck at home, but will demand remain this strong once people are comfortable going back to the gym? The UPS earnings are probably worth a close look for what they might say about the consumer economy, especially considering the quarter included the holiday season. Speaking of which, AMZN earnings could give clues into holiday sales, too, as well as a look at how AMZN?s cloud growth did in a very competitive environment where Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader. MSFT?s cloud growth was huge in its recent quarter. PYPL could be interesting for what, if anything, they have to say about cryptocurrency. Penn National Gaming, Inc (NASDAQ: PENN) is another one to look out for this week with so much interest in the gaming sector since we all got sent home. CHART OF THE DAY: FINDING NEW SUPPORT. After bouncing off its support of the 20-day moving average (yellow line), the S&P 500 Index (SPX?candlestick) broke below it on Wednesday and has traded below it since then. It?s now moved down to its 50-day moving average (blue line) and closed just a hair below it at 3714.18. It?s too early to tell if this will be the next support level but it?s something to keep an eye on. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Lots of Numbers: Data-wise, investors might want to keep their eyes open this morning for the latest on construction spending and the ISM manufacturing index. The manufacturing sector has generally had a good performance lately, and the ISM headline number last time out was the highest since 2018 at 60.7%. The employment index also grew. Analysts expect the headline number to be just a bit lower for January at 60.1%, according to research firm Briefing.com. The big data gorilla this week is employment on Friday. Jobs are always the number one number to watch, and last month?s report was disappointing. A lot of the losses were in just one sector, however?with Leisure and Hospitality positions falling by nearly 500,000 in December. We?ll dig more into expectations for the January report later this week. Technical Picture: The two big numbers to watch this week could be 30,000 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) and 3700 in the SPX. The two indices flirted with those levels late Friday, and the $DJI ultimately closed just below 30,000. If they hop back above those levels today and manage to hold on, that would probably be seen as a technical victory that could suggest a little recovery ahead. Longer-term technical support is in a range between 3633 and 3695, according to research firm CFRA. This is where the ?buy the dip? crowd meets a test: Will they still want to buy the dip after the main crunch of earnings season ends and the world continues to stumble trying to fight the pandemic?

What Happened: The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said in a statement that Apple?s prompts do not provide context about the benefits of personalized advertisements. ?To help people make a more informed decision, we're also showing a screen of our own, along with Apple?s. It will provide more information about how we use personalized ads, which support small businesses and keep apps free,? the social media said. Facebook noted that, if a user accepts its prompts, the ads they see won?t change. Agreeing to the prompt also doesn't lead to the collection of ?new types of data.? On the other hand, declining the prompt means customers will still see ads but they would be less relevant. ?We feel that people deserve the additional context, and Apple has said that providing education is allowed,? the social media behemoth said. Why It Matters: Facebook claimed it had no choice but to show Apple?s prompt because if they don?t ? the latter would block the social network from its App Store. Zuckerberg labeled Apple one of the biggest competitors of Facebook at the company?s fourth-quarter earnings conference last week.

What Happened: ?Apple's deep collaboration with current automakers (Hyundai Group, GM, and PSA [now part of Stellantis]) who have extensive development, production, and qualification experience will significantly shorten the Apple Car development time and create a time-to-market advantage,? Kuo wrote in a note, as per Apple Insider. Kuo said that the Tim Cook-led tech giant will ?leverage current automakers' resources and focus on self-driving hardware and software, semiconductors, battery-related technologies, form factor and internal space designs, innovative user experience, and the integration with Apple's existing ecosystem.? Why It Matters: The analyst does not expect an Apple vehicle to arrive until 2025 at the earliest and said the vehicle would be a ?very high-end? model or ?significantly higher? than a standard EV. Kuo dismissed the possibility that Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Ltd (OTC: HNHPF) ? also known as Foxconn ? would secure the assembly of the tech giant?s car. See Also: Foxconn Taps Nio Co-Founder Jack Cheng To Lead New Open EV Platform The expert claimed that the Cupertino, California-based company?s first EV will be built instead on Hyundai?s E-GMP platform. E-GMP is a dedicated battery electric vehicle platform that is made up of two motors and has a maximum range of 310 miles on a full charge. Reports out of South Korea last month suggested that Hyundai subsidiary Kia Corp. could make initial Apple vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Georgia. Apple?s veteran hardware chief, Dan Riccio, was recently reassigned to work on an unnamed new project directly under Cook. Price Action: Apple shares closed 1.65% higher at $134.14 on Monday.

2021-02-02 11:10:42 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-02 11:10:42 and 2021-02-02 12:27:27+00:00: With all of the activity happening in the market at the moment, it sometimes goes unappreciated that we are knee-deep in earnings season. Solid deliveries from market constituents like Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) as well as a slew of positive earnings from financials like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) have primed the pump for more upside surprises as companies close the books on a tumultuous 2020. Nevertheless, the recent volatility in the market has somewhat overshadowed the impact of these results as the market?s physics grapple with the activity of retail traders buying and selling stocks as a weapon against hedge funds and institutional traders. Individual traders hoping to navigate this earnings season in the midst of the market?s current unpredictability would do well to not only look at the fundamentals of these companies, but also analyze their recent chart performance using institutional-quality software like that from trading research firm VantagePoint. An upcoming free virtual demo of VantagePoint?s software will look to illustrate, using predictive charting and advanced A.I. technology, how traders can improve their accuracy and discover new opportunities in a seemingly unpredictable market. In anticipation of the free demonstration, we?ll take a look at some of the big reports incoming through the remainder of the Q4 earnings delivery season and how those deliveries might stack up against the current earnings environment and overall market ecosystem. High Expectation, Low Reward This month?s early earnings themes will be dominated by results from major technology and biotechnology names. This week alone will see incoming results from tech heavy-hitters like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Alibaba Group Holdings, Ltd. (NYSE: BABA), all of which are set to deliver results at the close of Tuesday?s session. They are all also anticipated to post year-over-year revenue results of anywhere from 15%-50% over this same period last year. Grab your VIP seat for VantagePoint's free online training here There are similarly high expectations for semiconductor companies like QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), reporting after Wednesday?s close, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), which is scheduled to report after the February 16 trading session. While that may seem like cause for bullishness in the technology space, keep in mind that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted similarly strong results in its earnings announcement last week. It has since traded lower by -5%. Obviously fundamentals are not the overriding predictor for stock performance, and predictive charting could help incorporate some of that middling response for upcoming earnings. One area that might show better post-earnings performance is the pharmaceutical and biotech space. Johnson & Johnson?s (NYSE: JNJ) Q4 earnings beat from last week put some pep in the company?s stock chart, and incoming results from Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) during premarket Wednesday and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) prior to Thursday?s open could do the same if they too are able to surprise on the upside. Consumer And Retail Brands Could Surprise Nevertheless, the fact remains that the market seems hesitant to reward stocks in high growth industries like tech and biotech, many of which have spent the latter half of 2020 outpacing the broad market by surging to new highs. While those market leaders may be in a holding pattern following their impressive gains throughout much of last year, incoming reports from consumer stocks may carry the right combination of earnings optimism and upside potential to spur some new buying in the event of an excellent report. Incoming results from consumer staples The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) are anticipated February 10th and 11th in the premarket sessions. While the former sustained a significant revenue loss through 2020 compared to 2019, both companies are coming off of solid Q3 numbers, and PEP is on pace for revenue growth in a year where not all companies can say that. Join VantagePoint's FREE live online training session to see how to use A.I. in your trading Depending on results and market reaction following KO and PEP?s reports, a similar story may play out in two other beverage staples set to report later in February, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE: BUD) and Ambev S.A. (NYSE: ABEV), which will deliver their Q4 number on February 25th during the premarket. The consumer will take the spotlight for several retail names that report toward the back half of the month into March, including Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) on the 18th, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) on the 23rd and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NYSE: COST) on March 4th. These consumer stocks have all seen consolidation in the first month of the year, so they may have the potential to gain upside traction in the event of strong sales figures. Of course, the current market is hard to anticipate, and traders should leverage whatever tools and data they can lay their hands on to get an advantage. VantagePoint?s software is designed to improve trading accuracy up to 87.4% using the same technology used by institutional traders.

2021-02-02 12:59:30 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-02 12:59:30 and 2021-02-02 14:45:44+00:00: The big story last week was a dramatic spike in volatility. Today, that appears to be unwinding quickly, perhaps lending some initial strength to the stock market. Futures on the major indices are advancing in the early going, and the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has moved back to the ?calm side? of 30, starting the day with a 27 handle. The plunge in volatility came as a couple of the big speculative plays from the last few days also appeared to come unwound. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) shares collapsed 40% in pre-market trading. Silver is also getting pounded, a day after what looked like a mini-boom. Hopes for progress on a fiscal stimulus and a generally positive earnings picture could be injecting new life and helping investors put last week?s crazy trading behind them, at least early on. It?s another action-packed earnings day on Wall Street, dominated by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) after the close. Don?t forget Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) this morning, which might be a good chance for an update on vaccine progress and production.\ Looking at the early earnings scorecard today, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) beat analysts? estimates across the board but the stock?s down a little. PFE raised its view for the year, which is good. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) numbers didn?t look great at first glance but the company had a one-time charge. Beyond that it looked like a solid quarter. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) also had good earnings. Overall, we seem to be having a good earnings season, not a great one. People are happy to see progress and hear CEOs talking about good things to come. Stocks haven?t been getting a major bump from earnings results, but there was a big runup going into the season, which could explain that. Turning The Dial Yesterday felt like easy listening on the radio again after the heavy metal thunder of last week, but it isn?t necessarily static-free. Volatility, even with today?s turn lower, remains well above where it was a week ago. Also, bond buying came back into the picture yesterday before retreating this morning. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked down to 1.07% on Monday before jumping back up to 1.11% this morning. Sometimes the bond market can be a good barometer of investor sentiment, and right now it does feel like things have turned around a bit since yesterday. This morning?s yield rally could potentially put Financial stocks and the Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index in line for some support. Now that you?ve read the fine print, it was good to see some stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) rebound after neither got any market credit for their solid earnings reports last week. There isn?t always just one reason why shares fall after a company surpasses earnings expectations, and plenty of theories got offered during the swirl of events that hit Wall Street the last few days. One idea, especially for AAPL, is that the stock had simply built in most of the good news ahead of time and fell victim to a bit of profit taking. One thing to note as more ?FAANGs? report later today (see below) is that the mega-caps like AAPL, its fellow FAANGs, and MSFT continue to dominate from a market capitalization standpoint, which means how they do on any given day often helps shape the overall market. Technically, it was positive Monday to see the SPX bounce off of its 50-day moving average near 3716, but keep in mind that it wasn?t able to come back and close above the 20-day moving average, now near 3792. It looks like the market is trying to find a trading range, and the SPX remains only about 2.5% below the all-time high posted last month. A close above 3792 today might suggest additional strength. ?Stay at home? stocks like the FAANGs and semiconductors did well yesterday, but you can?t really say it was just a stay at home rally. Not when you saw the RUT also bounce back in a big way. Consumer Discretionary also had a nice day, though that?s a mix of reopening and stay at home companies. Or ?drive-up? companies, shall we say, considering the way things look now at many big box stores. FAANG Earnings Wrap Up Today With Alphabet, Amazon Earnings afternoons don?t come much bigger than today, when Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) open their books. AMZN is expected to exceed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever in Q4 according to AMZN?s own quarterly guidance. Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $121.0 billion, or to grow between 28% and 38% compared with Q4 2019, though the company noted $4 billion in COVID-19 related costs are expected for Q4. Both holiday sales and the company?s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business are likely to be the focus when AMZN reports, but you might also want to monitor the company?s earnings call for the latest on other businesses like payments, fintech, or the company?s entry into the pharmacy segment. AMZN has also offered to help distribute the COVID-19 vaccine, but there haven?t been many details about this. The call could provide more insight. With GOOGL, we?ll see if ad revenue continued to bounce back after a strong Q3. GOOGL?s Q3 ad revenue of $37.1 billion?up 10% year over year following Q2?s negative 8%?appeared to indicate a revival from the pandemic damage of Q2. Ad revenue for Search and YouTube both looked strong in Q3, so the question is whether that momentum lasted into the end of the year. GOOGL crushed Wall Street?s expectations last time out, so that might put some pressure on them to do that again or risk disappointing the Street. Word From The Factory Floor The manufacturing economy slowed just a little last month, but remains in pretty decent shape all things considered. When you look at a reading like yesterday?s headline number of 58.7 from the Institute of Supply Management, it?s tempting to be disappointed because it fell from 60.5 the prior month and came in a bit below analysts? estimates. If you put it in context it gets a little easier to like. It?s still well above the 50 level that signifies expansion, and the previous month?s was the highest in three years. Solid growth in ISM like we?ve been seeing is often a positive sign that companies are out there spending and getting ready for heavy demand. It isn?t just in the U.S. where you see signs of manufacturing strength. Recent readings out of Europe and China also showed expansion, though China?s data fell slightly in January from December. Analysts said the slight dip in manufacturing activity early this year might have reflected pandemic-based shutdowns in some regions. CHART OF THE DAY: FOLLOW THE LEADER. The NYSE FANG+ Index ($NYFANG:IFUS?candlestick) has regained its place as a ?leading indicator? for the overall market over the last couple of years, and that?s been apparent over the last week. The FAANGs stumbled, and so did the broader market, demonstrated here by the S&P 500 Index (SPX?purple line). When FAANGs regained their feet yesterday, so did the SPX. Data Sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, NYSE. The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Right Where 2020 Left Off: The initial public offering (IPO) mania that gathered steam late last year doesn?t show signs of cooling so far in 2021. Companies have raised $13.4 billion through 24 IPOs so far this year, a 300% jump in listings from the same period last year, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing data from Renaissance Capital. The WSJ added that ?blank-check companies? continued to flood the market, with 91 gathering about $25 billion, nearly a third of the value raised throughout all of last year, according to SPACinsider.com. And there have been 111 offerings of additional shares by U.S.-listed companies, doubling the number from the same period a year earlier, Dealogic data show. In other words, the market remains abuzz, so to speak, with lots of new companies and a lot of investors looking for places to put the

This week we posed the following question related to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) acquiring another consumer discretionary company: Over the next year, should Apple acquire Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) or Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON)? About Apple Apple designs a wide variety of consumer electronic devices, including the iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Mac computers and Apple Watch smartwatches. As of 2020, the iPhone makes up the majority of Apple's total revenue. In addition, Apple offers its customers a variety of entertainment and payment services such as Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Card and Apple Pay. At the time of publication, Apple?s market cap is roughly $2.25 trillion. Meanwhile, the market caps of Netflix and Peloton are $238 billion and $42 billion, respectively. See Also: How To Buy Apple Stock Survey Says This week?s study found around 31% of respondents telling us Apple should complete an M&A deal with Netflix this year. Many respondents noted Apple TV+ currently lacks the appeal and fan-favorite programs that Netflix provides, and in order to avoid losing ground in the streaming market, a substantial change is required in its existing subscription platform. Seventeen percent of respondents said Apple would be best served to complete an M&A deal with Peloton. While respondents were quick to mention Peloton?s newfound popularity and success was in large part a result of the pandemic lockdown, many believed Apple will continue their push into the fitness sector and Peloton would be the perfect acquisition. Several noted Peloton has done well during the pandemic and will continue to do well as more people look for other options besides going to the gym to workout. Meanwhile, 17% said Apple would be best served completing an M&A with both Netflix and Peloton by 2022. Thirty-five percent of respondents said Apple should avoid moving forward with a Netflix or Peloton M&A deal this year. Ideas from respondents included the notion acquiring Netflix streaming would create an image of a monopoly that would have the potential to reflect negatively on Apple. A number of traders noted Peloton will lose ground in the near future, once communities get back to normal there will be a decrease in sales and memberships. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in February 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.

2021-02-03 13:15:44 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-03 13:15:44 and 2021-02-03 15:03:15+00:00: There?s a lot of talk about the return of ?boring? in Washington, D.C. Maybe it?s happening on Wall Street, too, and many investors would likely welcome that after the wild January we just had. Robust earnings late Tuesday from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) turned the focus back toward earnings this morning. Some of the frenzy moved to the fringes as the week continued, calming things a little. Volatility edged lower again early Wednesday as the short squeeze mania died down. Bonds also retreated, taking the 30-year yield up to nearly 2% and the 10-year yield up to 1.12%. The improving economy and expected stimulus are starting to show up in the bond market, and strong earnings might also be part of that. Earnings season usually turns the focus back toward the market?s inner workings, but that hadn?t been the case as much this time around with all these distractions. Now it feels as if we?re getting back to the things that really matter?boring but essential stuff like cash flow, R&D, SG&A. All those fun things that veteran market watchers love to dissect this time of year. Earnings season started out slow but keeps getting better. And now at least some companies are enjoying the fruits of their labors, so to speak, as investors reward stocks like GOOGL for strong quarterly performance. Earlier on this earnings season, it felt like meeting expectations often got companies punished, and even beating expectations didn?t bring much reward. Part of this might have to do with the market being up so much already. Bezos News Distracts From Huge Quarter Yesterday?s surprising announcement that AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos plans to leave his position later this year didn?t immediately seem to move shares, though everyone?s still soaking up the news. Maybe the stock didn?t react too much because he?s really not going anywhere. Bezos will be executive chairman, which means he?s likely to keep himself involved in at least some of the day-to-day business. Think back to when Bill Gates of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) left the CEO spot to become chairman in 2000. He kept playing a big role until 2006 when he officially stepped aside. Not to say it?s exactly the same situation with Bezos now, but that may be what some investors are thinking. MSFT?s stock didn?t move much the day Gates took a new position in 2006. One of the more interesting questions to ponder in coming months is what Andy Jassy?who?s set to take over as AMZN CEO in Q3 and currently heads cloud computing behemoth Amazon Web Services (AWS)?might have in mind when he grabs the wheel. He?s certainly going to bring a lot of cloud experience, and that?s been a huge focus of AMZN?s business (and success) lately. Getting down to nuts and bolts, AMZN joined Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the $100 billion quarterly revenue club by easily outpacing Wall Street analysts? expectations on earnings and revenue in Q4. It looks like holiday shopping helped the company. The question is whether AMZN shares can continue their rally, because lately the Tech stocks that beat on earnings got punished in the market. Think back to AAPL last week and MSFT not long before that. With those two, it felt like a classic ?buy the rumor, sell the news? scenario, though arguably AAPL got caught up in some of last week?s frenzy. Things were also in good shape over at GOOGL, on a very busy Tuesday afternoon. The company beat analysts? estimates on top- and bottom lines as well as in every business, quarterly ad revenue kept up its momentum from the prior quarter, and shares rocketed 7% to all-time highs in pre-market trading. So at least in GOOGL?s case so far, positive news isn?t being treated as a reason to take shares lower. Another big development Tuesday was plummeting volatility, but keep in mind that contracts farther out in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures complex indicate chances for higher values in the months ahead. This could serve as a warning sign that we?re far from out of the woods as far as volatility is concerned. That?s especially relevant after we saw VIX leap from 21 to 37 in just a day last week. This isn?t the sort of move that?s quickly forgotten, and it?s probably still reverberating in the market. The VIX?now back below 25?tends to spend a lot of time in certain trading ranges, so the next few days could help us get a sense of where that range might be. VIX had been between 20 and 25 for a while before last week?s surge. On the plus side, Treasury yields rebounded nicely yesterday. The 10-year yield made it back above 1.1% at times before ending the day just below that, and the Financial sector appeared to draw some strength from the yield move. Financials climbed 2.5% to lead all sectors yesterday, but every sector rose. The Russell 2000 (RUT) index of small-caps, heavily weighted toward banks, actually had a so-so day compared to most other indices, but still leads the major indices with a nearly 9% gain year-to-date. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) now has 2% gains for 2021 after falling into the red for the year late last week. It?s kind of amazing what two positive days can do. It?s hard to pinpoint a single reason why stocks have done so well so far this week. Growing optimism about vaccination progress, last week?s positive news on vaccine trials, the unwinding of some of last week?s short squeezes, hopes for a stimulus, some decent economic data, and improving earnings expectations (see more below) all could be playing a role. Payrolls Report Looms: Analysts Expect Anemic Growth Tuesday was pretty dead from a data perspective, but things pick up as the week continues. Initial claims and factory orders highlight tomorrow?s calendar, with analysts expecting claims at 825,000, research firm Briefing.com said. That would be down slightly from 847,000 the prior week, but this isn?t a statistic that?s fit into any particular pattern for a while. It bounces up and down pretty unpredictably, which is unfortunate because you?d like to see a steady downward trend. That just hasn?t happened. It?s the opposite case with Friday?s monthly jobs report, where you?d like to see a steady up-trend in job creation. The trend has definitely been in the wrong direction since last fall, reaching a new low last month when job losses outnumbered gains due to nearly 500,000 lost positions in the leisure and hospitality sector. That led to a net job loss of 140,000, but remember it wasn?t all bad. There were plenty of green shoots as job gains occurred in construction, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, health care, and manufacturing. If those sectors continued to add jobs in January, it would probably make people feel better about the overall report even if leisure and hospitality again drags things down. The average analyst estimate is for total job growth of 50,000 in January, Briefing.com said. That?s a pretty anemic number when you compare it to typical monthly growth of around 150,000 to 200,000 in the years before the pandemic. Analysts expect hourly wages to rise about 0.3% in January, down from 0.8% in December. That uptick in December wages might have reflected the loss of leisure and hospitality jobs, an industry where pay tends to be low. Also, keep an eye on the U6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers. It fell to 11.7% in December from 12% in November, but remains historically high. If the economy really starts improving, this number should start dropping dramatically as more people find a way back into the workforce. CHART OF THE DAY: CARVING A RANGE? After the S&P 500 Index (SPX?candlestick) dropped below its 20-day moving average (blue line) last week and briefly testing its 50-day moving average (red line) on Friday, it rebounded to close Tuesday above the 20-day again. This could be a sign of strong technical support at the 50-day. Any closes above the 20-day MA (now right near 3800) going forward could potentially indicate more strength ahead. If that doesn?t happen, it?s possible it could bounce back and fort

2021-02-03 16:53:54 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-03 16:53:54 and 2021-02-03 18:42:47+00:00: The end of January is reserved for learning how tech and e-commerce companies did during the holiday season. More precisely, all FAAMG stock, namely Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), have now shown just how much they crushed the holiday season. Amazon's Blockbuster Quarter Amazon has beaten the revenue expectations for the past consequent seven quarters, pushed by COVID-19 driven e-commerce and cloud business. The previous two quarters had the most impressive realization in revenues compared to the expectations and this time around, Amazon delivered its largest quarter by revenue of all time, generating $125.56 billion in sales. Since the amount of US online purchases grew 32% to $188 billion during this record-breaking holiday season, no wonder Amazon had its first $100 billion quarter, with revenue increasing 44% from last year's quarter. Outside of its core business, the cloud-computing segment fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations of $12.83 billion but did increase 28% from last year's quarter $9.95 billion to $12.7 billion. Refinitiv analysts expected $7.23 earnings per share which would be a moderate increase of 11% compared to the previous year. Amazon delivered $14.09 while it had higher costs than usual as it also paid a one-time $300 bonus to front line employees in November. In Q1 of 2021, COVID-19-related costs are expected to drop to about $2 due to lower volumes. Revenue for Q1 2021 is expected to be in the range between $100 billion and $106 billion, although less than the holiday blockbuster quarter, still greater 33% and 40% from a year earlier with profit in the range profit of between $3 billion and $6.5 billion. As for the whole year, sales surged 38% to $386.1 whereas profit roughly doubled to $21.3 billion compared to 2019. Jack Ma's Friction With Beijing Cast A Shadow Over Alibaba's Strong Results And Surge In Sales Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's (NYSE: BABA) core business, e-commerce, also benefited from the COVID-19 driven trend to do more shopping online from the comfort of our own homes. Also on Tuesday, Alibaba has beaten the expectations and reported an increase of 37% in revenues in the quarter ended in December, compared to a year earlier. However, its strong results have been overshadowed by the Chinese government which is taking a more conservative approach towards entrepreneurs who own large tech businesses. Jack Ma, Alibaba's co-founder, has been negatively affected by this approach and some analysts and experts are concerned this friction could hamper Alibaba's growth as they did pull the plug on Ant Group's IPO two days before it was supposed to take place. These factors cloud also undermine the investor's confidence in Amazon and other tech companies. The government fears that big private tech companies have too much influence and power on the financial industry and other sensitive segments. Latest Developments Alibaba's long-term investors might see the governmental pressure as nothing else but noise as Jack Ma China is leading a company that is on top of China's technological capabilities and well-positioned to benefit from digitalization of consumption, along with growing spending power. As for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and the man who fundamentally changed how we buy stuff, he will be stepping down from his CEO role in the Q3 of 2021 to focus more on strategy as the executive chairman of the company. This transition should be a smooth one, since Bezos' right-hand Andy Jassy, who joined Amazon in 1997 and now serves as CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking the helm as the new CEO.

2021-02-03 16:57:26 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-03 16:57:26 and 2021-02-03 18:48:36+00:00: On Tuesday, Google's parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) literally crushed it with its last reported quarter. Despite Alphabet announcing that its cloud business remained unprofitable, Google's core advertising business overperformed estimates, leading its stock price to rise 8% . What Do Fourth-Quarter Figures Say? Alphabet's gross revenues rose 23% to $56.9 billion, while profit rose by an astonishing 45% year-over-year, to $22.30 an adjusted share. This surpasses analyst's expectations by 6.78%, since they projected gross revenues of $52.8 billion, with earnings per share $18.59, which is almost 20% less than achieved. Net revenue minus traffic acquisition costs (TAC) of $46.42 billion topped the estimates by 6.22%. TAC has risen 23% to $10.47 billion since Google relies on Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), partner sites, and third-party applications to generate higher mobile advertising revenues. Furthermore, Alphabet disclosed Google Cloud's operating result for the first time, presenting that this part of the business made a $5.61 billion loss during 2020, and a $1.24 billion loss during Q4. Cloud business revenues were $3.83 billion, while analysts expected $3.8 billion. This presents a 47% year-over-year increase. Despite the loss, Google will continue to develop its cloud unit through disciplined investments to scale the business and improve profitability, as Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stated. On the other hand, its rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported its cloud business earned an operating profit of $13.53 billion in 2020. Advertising Business Is Shining Brightly Advertising revenue for the fourth quarter amounted to $46.20 billion, which is approximately 22% higher, comparing to the same quarter of 2019 when the company generated $37.93 billion. Q4 2020 showed the best performance in the last 16 quarters for this internet titan. It implies the total recovery of the pandemic, unlike Q2 when the company recorded an 8% annualized decrease in ad revenues year-over-year for the first time in history. YouTube ads soared 46% comparing to Q4 2019, with earnings of $4.72 billion. YouTube performance is particularly strong in direct-response ads, which practically did not exist threeyears ago, said Google's Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler. Furthermore, YouTube reaches more 18?49-year-olds than all TV networks together, with more than 100 million people streaming YouTube from their TVs. Perspectives for growth, therefore, remain strong and robust. Can Antitrust Lawsuits Affect Its Earnings? Despite a successful year, there might be some trouble in paradise. Due to the pandemic, more people became more dependent than ever on the internet which helped Google thrive. Therefore, regulators became even more concerned that Google is using its search engine, mapping service, and Android operating system to gain an unfair advantage. Both the US Department of Justice and the US group of states led by Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit. Google said that these lawsuits were "deeply flawed" and this is certainly not the first time the tech giant is being grilled by regulators, but it remains to be seen whether these allegations can have a negative impact on Google's overall performance.

(NASDAQ: PYPL). The payments business exploits secular growth trends, starting with the ongoing trend towards detachment from cash, which has resulted in a strong digital payments growth over the last decade, according to a 2020 McKinsey report. The structural growth of the payments market is clearly visible in network companies and for processor/merchant acquirers. Aside from moving money, innovations such as NFC cards for proximity use, peer-to-peer (P2P) feature and push payments support the ecosystem. An E-Commerce Accelerated Trend: Samuel Traub, Equity Research Analyst - Banks/Insurance at Credit Suisse, pointed out that the e-commerce secular trend is also growing fast, pushing digital payments activities and creating new needs. Both incumbent and newcomer operators have developed capabilities in remote digital payments, with PayPal leading the way in online payments. On the customer side, innovative solutions have also emerged such as digital wallets and P2P payment apps, reflecting the preference for convenience and speed, made possible by smartphone penetration. Big Tech Hesitates To Get In: The Credit Suisse analyst noted that big tech names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have been making waves the industry for some time now, taking advantage of the user base size and also aiming to create a connection among merchants in order to facilitate consumer-to-business payments. However, for the time being, Big Tech hesitates to enter a heavily regulated industry and prefer to partner with credit cards and banks, even though they may use their payment capabilities as a backdoor to build a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platform in the future. Investment Names And Ideas: Having said that, despite generally lofty valuations, Credit Suisse sees attractive investment opportunities in the larger global card networks - with a preference for Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) - but also considers digital-enabled merchant acquirers and processors with a broad range of products and international experience such as Adyen (OTC: ADYEY), PayPal, Fiserv Inc. (NYSE: FISV), Square Inc. (NYSE: SQ) and Global Payments Inc. (NYSE: GPN). This article originally appeared on Financialounge.com and was translated from Italian to English.

Any tech investor during the past five years knows just how much of the recent growth in the tech sector is attributed to the five growth superstars of the Nasdaq: Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These so-called FAANG stocks continue to deliver year-after-year of incredible growth numbers, even as their market caps swell to some of the largest in market history. While other companies were crushed by the pandemic, these FAANG stocks thrived in an environment of social distancing and remote working. Related Link: ,000, 5 Years Later: How Much Would Microsoft Stock Be Worth? Tech Leadership Continues: Investors have done extremely well overall in the past five years, but some stocks have certainly performed better than others. The S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 110.5%, but the Nasdaq?s total return in that stretch is an incredible 198.9%. The Nasdaq kicked off 2016 trading at around 4,900. Concerns over slowing economic growth in China sent the index tumbling to as low as 4,209.76 in early 2016, its low point of the past five years. From that point, growth numbers from the FAANG group and the rest of the tech sector sent the Nasdaq on a tear. The index broke the 6,000 mark in 2017 and 8,000 mark in 2018. At that point, the Nasdaq ran out of steam. A trade war with China, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and ramping regulatory scrutiny of the FAANG stocks sent the Nasdaq tumbling back down to as low as 6,190 by the end of the year. From there the rally resumed, and the Nasdaq was back making new all-time highs again by mid-2019. The index ultimately peaked at 9,838 prior to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic sell-off in March, which dropped the Nasdaq all the way back down to 6,631. The sell-off was short-lived, however, and the Nasdaq hit the 10,000 mark for the first time during the summer of 2020. The index ultimately peaked at 13,728 in January of 2021 before pulling back slightly to around 13,338 today. Patience Pays Off: At this point, the FAANG stocks have grown into complete tech sector juggernauts. But some of them have made for better investments than others over the past five years. Here?s a breakdown of how much buying $1,000 in each stock back in 2016 would be worth today, assuming reinvested dividends: Facebook: $2,302 Amazon: $5,462 Apple: $5,854 Netflix: $5,797 Alphabet: $2,400 Overall, a $5,000 investment in these five stocks split evenly during the past five years would be worth $21,815 today, a 336.3% gain over a five-year period. Benzinga?s Take: All five of the FAANG stocks have outpaced the 111.5% total return of the S&P 500 over the past five years. Amazon, Apple and Netflix have also each more than doubled the overall return of the Nasdaq during that stretch. (Photo by Zo?

(NASDAQ: QCOM) shares pulled back Thursday in the wake of the company's first-quarter report. The Qualcomm Analysts: Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy maintained a Buy rating on Qualcomm shares and upped the price target from $175 to $180. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore maintained an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $171 to $167. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated a Strong Buy rating and $190 price target. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating and $180 price target. Why Qualcomm's 5G Upgrade Prospects Are Intact: Qualcomm delivered an in-line revenue quarter, with industrywide capacity constraints limiting upside to revenue, Rosenblatt analyst Cassidy said in a note. Earnings exceeded expectations due to a higher gross margin, which benefited from certain customers making early and unexpected deliveries of products, the analyst said. The guidance for a seasonal decline in March quarter revenue and a sharp sequential decline in margin at the Qualcomm Technology Licensing segment should disappoint investors, he said. "We see this as temporary and not a structural change to the company's profitability." The guidance for a 4% sequential decline in the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies segment revenue is well above the 15% seasonal decline, Cassidy said. The upside will stem from increasing content in 5G smartphones and strong demand for adjacent automotive and IoT products, the analyst said. Rosenblatt said it sees no structural change to Qualcomm's prospects in front of the 5G upgrade cycle. Related Link: Qualcomm Analysts Hail Huawei Settlement As Asserting Company's 5G Tech Leadership Morgan Stanley Sees Qualcomm Tailwinds: Qualcomm's Chipsets segment revenue guidance for the March quarter was stronger than expected, but the company signaled a drawdown in the June quarter, Morgan Stanley analyst Moore said. View more earnings on QCOM This, along with lower royalty revenues for the March and June quarters, makes the quarter a complicated one, the analyst said. Operating expenses were slightly higher, and mix-related gross margin pressure is evident in chipsets, he said. All of these factors will be negative for the June quarter, Moore said. Royalties will reflect weaker expectations from Huawei in the March quarter and beyond, the analyst said. Yet the Huawei shortfall has been a key driver of the chipset outperformance, as the market share that previously accrued to Huawei shifts to Qualcomm customers, he said. Morgan Stanley said it still sees the potential for Qualcomm's tailwinds to resume going forward. Raymond James Sticks To Qualcomm Thesis: Qualcomm delivered a mixed report in which supply constraints failed to deliver the upside the Street had hoped for, Raymond James analyst Caso said. Yet the March quarter was solidly ahead and better than seasonal, with auto/IoT continuing to beat expectations, the analyst said. Commentary on the June quarter, he said, implied that chipset revenue would decline by about 14% sequentially due to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) seasonality. The China revenue opportunity ? driven by replacing Huawei/HiSilicon ? is now pushed to the second half of fiscal 2021 due to supply constraints, Caso said. "Net, the report probably isn't good enough for today given the stock's recent run, but it also doesn't change our thesis, and our FY22 numbers remain largely unchanged." Qualcomm's 2021 Looks Robust, KeyBanc Says: The company expects the supply constraints to impact first-half results and normalize in the second half, analyst Vinh said in a note. According to the company, the key drivers for 2021 are an anticipated high-single-digit annual increase in total global handset shipment, a doubling of 5G smartphones in 2021 to 500 million and anticipated share gains related to other OEMs gaining share at the expense of Huawei, the analyst said. QCOM Price Action: At last check, Qualcomm shares were retreating 8.83% to $147.97. Related Link: 'Halftime Report' Final Trades: Qualcomm, Blackstone And More Photo: Qualcomm.

2021-02-05 13:16:36 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-05 13:16:36 and 2021-02-05 14:57:02+00:00: With an incredible four-day winning streak and a fresh record high under its belt, can the S&P 500 Index (SPX) go five for five? If that?s going to happen, the market will have to overcome what looks at first glance like a slightly disappointing January jobs report. This week?s strong gains have been fueled by solid earnings and hope about the economy, and investors got another shot of optimism after the Senate approved a plan that will allow President Biden?s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to pass regardless of the level of Republican support. With its direct payments to Americans, investors have been hoping the stimulus will give consumer spending a shot in the arm and help boost the economic recovery while vaccines are becoming more widespread. Jobs Report: A Check Of The Numbers In economic news, the government?s non-farm payrolls number for January came in at 49,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 6.3% from 6.7%. A Briefing.com consensus had expected a headline number of 50,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 6.7%. While the headline number was no big surprise, it still wasn?t anywhere near as good as numbers we saw last summer and fall. Looking just at the headline number, it feels like a slight win for the labor market in its battle with the coronavirus, but it appears we?re far from out of the woods due to some disappointing aspects deeper in the data. For example, December job losses were even worse than thought, with the government revising that number down to 227,000 jobs lost vs. its original estimate of 140,000. November jobs growth was also revised lower. This could help explain why the government?s first estimate for Q4 gross domestic product growth was lower than some analysts had expected. The fact that jobs gains remained pretty tepid in January could indicate that sluggish economic growth is continuing into Q1, though we won?t see the government?s Q1 GDP estimate for a few months. When GDP doesn?t grow strongly, it can ultimately wind up being reflected in company earnings. On a more positive note, January job losses were far less dramatic for the leisure and hospitality sector than the nearly 500,000 losses seen there in December. Perhaps that means the lockdown effect is slowing a little. We?ll have to wait and see. Digging Deeper The bad news is that the construction, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation sectors either shed jobs in January or barely gained. That?s not a sign of health in the manufacturing economy. These are the areas where you?d like to see more robust jobs growth if the economy is coming back. Digging into these numbers a bit more, the decline in transportation jobs probably reflects airline layoffs, while seasonal factors could play into construction job losses. Meanwhile, healthcare employment is down by more than 500,000 from a year ago, perhaps because of less demand for typical healthcare because of people staying home. It?s important to remember that these are only a data drop from one snapshot in time. It can take a few reports for the trends to show up. It?s good to see the slight job growth in January after December?s disappointing showing. And again, this report looks a bit worse than it might have otherwise been due to the continued cratering of leisure and hospitality jobs. Stock index futures remained higher in pre-market trading, perhaps indicating a day of further gains for the stock market. Despite the early strength today, investors may want to watch out for some pressure later in the session from profit-taking, especially at the end of what?s shaping up to be such a strong week. Looking Up Solid economic data took center stage yesterday as good news from the nation?s labor market and factories helped move stocks higher. The weekly jobless claims number?which has been a closely watched barometer of economic health during the pandemic?was quite a bit better than expected. Initial claims came in at 779,000 when a Briefing.com consensus had expected 825,000. It was also encouraging to see that the prior week?s number revised down to 812,000 from 847,000. The improvement in the labor market is a welcome sign, but nearly 780,000 new applications is above the pre-pandemic high of 695,000 and shows that the U.S. economy is far from out of the woods. With that in mind, investors were probably thinking that the still-high number won?t dent the probability of another government stimulus effort with direct payments to Americans. Data on factory orders were also better than forecast, with December orders rising 1.1% compared with a 0.7% consensus from Briefing.com. The prior month?s data also was revised higher, to 1.3% from 1%. A key measure of business spending found in the report?nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft? rose 0.7%. One way to look at it is as a positive-signal feedback loop. When businesses are willing to spend more, it can indicate they have a more favorable outlook on the economy, which would be in line with recently upwardly-revised estimates for the global economy in 2021. Those upwardly-revised estimates can give businesses and consumers an added layer of confidence. Better Expectations It appears optimism is coming as coronavirus cases fall and the vaccine rollout gains steam, contributing to a brighter picture for travel and leisure activities and consumer spending at physical retail stores, restaurants, and theaters. Plus, corporate borrowing costs are relatively low given the Fed?s ultra-low short-term interest rate. And there?s the expectation of more stimulus to come from Washington. The strong stock-market move to the upside yesterday signaled that investors had flipped their risk-appetite switches to the ?on? position. That helped dampen demand for U.S. government debt, sending the yield on the 10- and 30-year Treasuries higher. Gold prices fell sharply (see chart below). After today?s big jobs number, investors may want a break from economic data. Next week?s economic calendar is relatively light, but there are still important reports on inflation, jobless claims and consumer sentiment. Meanwhile, the earnings calendar next week is pretty busy. Scheduled earnings reports are expected to paint a broad picture of different parts of the economy. As usual, investors will likely be paying just as much attention, or perhaps more, to executives? outlooks as they do to the top and bottom lines for the quarter. High-profile quarterly reports include those from Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP), Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER), AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ: AZN), and Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). CHART OF THE DAY: GOLD DULLS: The risk-on sentiment Thursday helped pressure gold, which is often bought in times of uncertainty and sold when the mood lightens. Higher Treasury yields also pressured the precious metal by making non-interest-bearing gold less appealing. Combine all that with additional pressure coming from a rising greenback?dampening demand for dollar-denominated gold by making it more expensive for those holding other currencies?and gold slipped below the psychologically important $1,800 mark.

Vaulting Valuations: The market justifiably pays attention to the FAANG stocks because they are huge and widely held. But investors also may want to pay attention to their valuations. Two in particular bear watching?Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX). Both have benefited as more people stay at home during the pandemic, and investors seem to also be expecting solid earnings to continue as AMZN?s price-to-earnings ratio vs. the next twelve months of earning estimates has been north of 70 while NFLX?s has been above 50. For perspective, the SPX?s forward P/E ratio has been in the low 20s. Tailwinds for stocks in general include an improving global econ

2021-02-05 14:02:35 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-05 14:02:35 and 2021-02-05 15:52:47+00:00: Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) had a very successful year. Records were beaten during the pandemic-embodied 2020, with a solid perspective ahead for the upcoming period. Unlike Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), which could potentially feel a damaging impact of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming privacy changes, both Snap and Pinterest went below the radar, with a strong performance during the fourth quarter of 2020. Snap's 4Q Figures Snap fourth-quarter results topped expectations, mostly due to an increase in internet advertising of its flagship application Snapchat and due to an increase in the number of users. Namely, 4Q revenues were $911.3 million, exceeding $856.1 million expected by Bloomberg analysts by 6.45%. The company generated $560.9 million of revenues in 4Q 2019 and therefore achieved a 62% increase. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter amounted to 9 cents vs. 7 cents expected, while the company earned 3 cents per share year-over-year. Furthermore, fourth-quarter revenue growth was 62%, which presented the fastest growth rate since the company went public in 2017. It is clear that advertisers started spending more money on ads, after lying low in 2Q 2020 in a COVID-ravaged economy. For the first time, the company has achieved its first full-year profit on an adjusted EBITDA basis. Observing the number of daily active users, Snap made a 22% increase to 265 million, also topping estimates. Furthermore, Snap's average revenue per user jumped strongly 33% to $3.44. Still, it's not so shiny after all as Snap expects first-quarter adjusted EBITDA loss between $50 million and $70 million, while analysts expected a forecast of $17.5 million profit. On the other end, the company expects revenues between $720 million and $740 million, which is above the expected $705 million. Despite the growing advertiser base, the key point in the following period will be maintaining the momentum once the pandemic restrictions are put to ease and users get to go out of their houses and away from their devices. Snap shares rose 208% over the past 12 months, and 17% year-to-date. Pinterest 4Q Figures Pinterest has beaten both top and bottom-line estimates on Thursday when it announced its 4Q results. As a result, its stock rose 10% in after-hours trading. Transformed into key figures, Pinterest reached $706 million in revenues, which is 9% higher than expected. The number of monthly active users jumped to 459 million vs. 449.4 million expected. Earnings per share surged to 43 cents, while 32 cents were projected, presenting a 34% upside. The average revenue per user amounted to $1.57, topping expectations by 9%. Overall, 4Q figures reflect a strong quarter with huge perspectives for growth. Namely, Pinterest's international revenues surged almost 100% in 4Q 2020 compared to 2019, and the vision board platform is just getting started. The average revenue per user in the US in 3Q was $3.85, while the international average revenues per user were just 21 cents. Therefore, revenue-generating potential is enormous. Pandemic Is Not The Enemy As Far As Social Media Is Concerned To summarize, although almost all industries will remember 2020 as the worst in the 21st century, Big Tech and social media giants achieved unprecedented records by becoming essential in a pandemic-shaped reality. Despite Facebook's failed attempts to crush these two companies, their robust 4Q performance has positioned them well to continue their winning streak, especially as they are parent-friendly and controversy-free, unlike the social media gorilla which has quite a few battles to fight on those fronts.

What Happened? On this day in 19i71, the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation was launched. Where Was The Market? The S&P 500 was at 97.45 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 882.12. What Else Was Going On? In 1971, Charles Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, and Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) opened Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. A gallon of gas cost 40 cents. NASDAQ Opens Its Doors: The NASDAQ was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers. When it opened for trading in February 1971, the NASDAQ was the first fully automated stock market in the world. It originated as a quotation system for stock prices but soon allowed for electronic trading as well. The Nasdaq went on to become the first U.S. market to allow online trading and assumed most of the trading that was previously conducted over-the-counter. During the tech boom of the 1980s and 1990s, the Nasdaq became the primary exchange for companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). The NASDAQ Composite started with just 50 companies in 1971. Today, the Nasdaq is home to more than 2,800 stocks, including the world?s most valuable company: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Investors can even take their own stake in Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ: NDAQ), which currently trades at a market cap of more than $23 billion. Photo by Luis Villa del Campo/Wikimedia.

2021-02-08 12:56:22 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-08 12:56:22 and 2021-02-08 14:40:52+00:00: Wall Street has a tough act to follow, and that?s not a reference to last night?s game. Stocks rose every day last week, which is hard to pull off twice in a row. What could break the five-day winning streak? Well, you?ve got a lot of things that almost feel like they?re pointing toward inflation. For instance, the 10-year yield has been galloping along, recently reaching almost 1.2%. That?s up nearly 20 basis points from late January, but still historically low. Rising yields can signal improving economic conditions and hopes for more fiscal stimulus, but also might get some people nervous about inflation prospects. Crude prices are also accelerating, which is nice if you?re an Energy sector investor but not so great if you?re an airline still dealing with weak travel demand. Now your jet fuel costs are also rising. Meanwhile, you may have noticed you?re paying more at the pump. Gas prices hit $3 a gallon in some places over the weekend. Crude powered through $57 a barrel early Monday. Volatility keeps easing, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) now approaching the lower end of its long-term range down near 20. This is a level the VIX hasn?t been below in a year, and some analysts suspect it won?t anytime soon due to the heavy options activity still going on. This week?s earnings schedule is dominated by old stalwarts of the U.S. economy like Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), and Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). Almost 80 S&P 500 companies report over the next five days. Stocks have a positive tone early on, helped in part by stimulus expectations. On another note, bitcoin rose above $43,000 this morning after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) invested $1.5 billion. Taking An Early Spring Break? The way the market behaved Friday, it almost felt like investors were putting the pandemic behind them. Obviously we?re still in the thick of it, but that can?t stop people from hoping for better, apparently. Look at the types of stocks that caught a tailwind late last week and it?s obvious the reopening hypothesis continues to gain strength. Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN), MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM), Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV), and Hilton Hotels Corporation (NYSE: HLT) all threw a party, putting Wall Street in vacation mode. Meanwhile, the Technology sector brought up the rear on Friday despite many of us still being locked down with our laptops. Generally, cyclical and small-cap stocks that tend to benefit from reopening and fiscal stimulus led the charge much of last week. The disappointing jobs report Friday (see more below) might have strengthened hopes for a large stimulus package from Congress, research firm Briefing.com observed, maybe lending some support to cyclicals. Maybe it?s a case of early spring fever, and it might not last. The market has come very far, very fast, raising concerns about valuations. On the one hand, the current rock bottom Fed interest rates can make people more comfortable with higher valuations, as my fellow TDA Network* contributor Kevin Hincks pointed out Friday afternoon. On the other hand, Treasury yields resumed their upward climb last week after falling in late January (see more below). While some analysts think the 10-year yield would have to climb roughly another 80 basis points to really start weighing on stocks, it may not be a coincidence that large growth stocks in Tech?which tend to be more rate sensitive?had some tough sledding Friday. Two of the biggest behemoths, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), didn?t participate in the rally. Earnings Onslaught Not Leaving Town The biggest chunk of earnings season is behind us, and so far, about 80% of S&P 500 companies have beaten Wall Street?s earnings estimates, according to FactSet. That may sound great, but keep in mind that analysts? projections weren?t much to write home about. They?ve had to keep raising them as actual numbers came in. What might matter more than earnings is revenue. A company can do lots of stuff to make the bottom line shine, but when it comes to bad revenue, there?s no place to hide. Through late last week, the revenue numbers weren?t amazing, but 75% of companies had done better than analysts projected. Again, we?re dealing with low expectations during the pandemic. As Barron?s pointed out, however, earnings are actually rising year over year in Q4, not too shabby when you consider that Q4 2020 was during the pandemic and Q4 2019 wasn?t. That speaks to the amazing resilience of so many companies, but also to the way big Tech and Communications Services firms have been able to take advantage of the ?stay at home? economy to grow faster than many had expected. So far, Tech and Health Care are doing the best this earnings season, with Energy and Industrial firms trailing the pack.= Keep An Eye On Guidance As Earnings Flow Continues The earnings parade slows a bit this week but it?s far from over. Some of the firms we?re expecting to hear from include Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR), KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP), Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC), GM, Uber Technoloiges Inc (NYSE: UBER), AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ: AZN), and DIS. As usual, investors will likely be paying just as much attention to executives? outlooks as they do to the top and bottom lines. On the data side, this week brings consumer price index data and University of Michigan sentiment. In the past, a tepid jobs report like Friday?s might have boosted the market by keeping concerns of a rate hike off the table. It feels like a long time since we had that kind of thinking following a jobs report, simply because the Fed has promised to keep rates near zero for years to come. Speaking of the Fed, it?s front and center this Wednesday when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on ?The State of the U.S. Labor Market? as part of an Economic Club of New York webinar. That presentation will be broadcast live. CHART OF THE DAY: HALFWAY BACK. The 10-year Treasury yield (TNX?candlestick) resumed climbing last week after a short break, and is now about halfway back to where it was pre-Covid a year ago, as this one-year chart shows. During that same time period, the S&P 500 Index (SPX?purple line) has surpassed the early 2020 highs, but rising yields could pose a threat to more gains. Data Sources: Cboe, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Rising Costs: Despite Friday?s soft employment data, bonds continued to decline as the old week ended. The 30-year bond yield came within striking distance of 2% by early Monday at 1.99%. If nothing else, this may get people a little concerned about possible rising mortgage rates, which would be a double-whammy for home buyers already facing the highest prices ever. The last time the 30-year yield topped 2% was nearly a year ago, last Feb. 19. Even that pre-pandemic yield was down sharply from a peak of 3.46% in November 2018. If there is inflation concern in the market, it could come from the commodities. Crude has done nothing but climb so far this year, and the metals complex is also starting to shine (aside from gold). Copper?an important industrial metal used in all sorts of products?is trading at levels last seen in 2012. You can?t necessarily rule out commodity inflation spoiling the party stocks are throwing. Buying Ink by the Barrel: The New York Times Co (NYSE: NYT) reported earnings last week and shared a pretty amazing statistic: Subscribership keeps rising and recently hit 7.5 million. The paper?s management has a goal of 10 million subscribers by 2025. Go back about 20 years and you would have found lots of armchair experts telling you newspapers were a dead business due to the rise of the internet. In a way, they had a point. Thousands of small local newspapers have gone out of business, and that?s a shame. At the same time, big guys like NYT and the Wall Street

Crypto A Better Bet For Apple? Apple should be following in the footsteps of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and buying cryptocurrencies, rather than tackling EV manufacturing, analyst Mitch Steves said in a note, according to Bloomberg. Tesla revealed in a 10-K filing Monday that it holds about $1.5 billion in reserves as Bitcoin and also plans to accept payments for sales in the digital currency on a limited basis. If Apple were to develop the Apple Wallet into a crypto exchange, it could have a sizable new market opportunity in the billions, the RBC analyst said. Apple Wallet is a mobile app included with the iOS that allows users a convenient way to organize and use rewards cards, boarding passes, tickets, gift cards and more in one place. Square Inc (NYSE: SQ), which is estimated to have an installed base of about 30 million users, generated about $1.6 billion per quarter from Bitcoin-related trading, Steves said. Assuming only 200 million of Apple's installed user base of 1.5 billion trades, the market opportunity is about 6.66 times larger than Square, the analyst estimates. Related Link: 10 Things Apple Investors May Wish For In 2021 Security Is Apple's Sales Proposition: If Apple decides to enter the market, it can immediately gain share, Steves said. The analyst noted that companies such as Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Square as well as closely-held exchanges such as Coinbase have all validated the business model. Apple can offer more secure transactions than the rest in the industry, the analyst said. A Win-Win Proposition? Just as cryptocurrency could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Apple, more users using an Apple exchange could boost the price of Bitcoin, Steves said. Bitcoin was trading at 14.39% higher at $43,993 at last check. Apple Park in Cupertino, California. Photo by Daniel Lu via Wikimedia.

2021-02-09 12:34:56 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-09 12:34:56 and 2021-02-09 14:18:03+00:00: What if we told you Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) would shutter parks and dock cruise ships during a big chunk of the busy season, do a phased reopening with limited capacity that could last well beyond a year, start a global battle with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) and the stock would essentially double over the period? You might think we?re talking fairy tales. But there?s no fable here. Since the onset of the pandemic nearly a year ago when DIS stock hit a 52-week low of $79.07 in March, shares have more than doubled, closing out last week nearly 130% higher. On a year-over-year basis, the stock is up nearly 30% compared with about 17% for the S&P 500 index (SPX). Those are facts. See also: How to Buy Disney Stock What?s more, adjusted earnings for DIS in the fiscal year that ended Oct. 3 collapsed by 64%, the company reported. And that came after a 94% earnings pullback in its fiscal Q3. And when the world?s largest entertainment conglomerate unwraps its Q1 earnings Thursday, Wall Street is widely expecting another deep double-digit dive compared with year-ago results. What?s going on in the Magic Kingdom? Not much. Remember, the theme parks and cruise ships went dark during last spring?s lockdowns, and have slowly begun reopening the gates at limited capacity since then. When DIS shutters a park, it loses not only the gate revenue but also those hotel, dining, and shopping dollars as well. Don?t forget, too, like every other major Hollywood studio, DIS, which produces movies out of Pixar, Marvel and Walt Disney Studios, had to halt film releases in theaters and carefully orchestrate movie-making in the age of COVID. It laid off 32,000 workers last year, saw ad revenues from ESPN dribble away and has struggled with its retail operations. DIS? share price story (see chart below) seems to rest with Wall Street?s anticipation that once the world harnesses the coronavirus and its variants, and vaccinations become more widespread, everything will be all-systems-go at the House of Mouse as pent-up demand is unleashed. Oh, and there?s Disney+ to consider, analysts said. Since a marathon investor day in December, analysts have largely been upping expectations based on DIS executives? guidance and the onslaught of movies they expect to be released soon. They also widely believe DIS?s future is as much in direct-to-consumer (DTC) experiences as it is in theme parks and movies. FIGURE 1: BEYOND THE PARK CLOSURES. Like much of the market?including the Communication Services Sector ($IXC - purple line)?sentiment turned positive on Walt Disney (DIS - candlestick) after the initial COVID-19 scare in March 2020. Data sources: NYSE, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Battle With Netflix Disney+ might underscore how quickly a DTC streaming business can grow?if circumstances (like sequestered families and limited entertainment alternatives) present themselves. With only one birthday under its belt, Disney+ was reaching 86.8 million subscribers as of Dec. 2, the company reported at its investor day. That was up nearly 20% from the 73 million subscriber base as of the end of Q4. Analysts said they?ll be listening for fresh numbers, and comparing the trajectory to internal forecasts that see the base tripling by 2024?to a jaw-dropping level of between 230 million and 260 million subscribers. DIS executives have also said they plan to up the price a buck to $7.99 per month. Though NFLX is the king of streaming services that DIS hopes to dethrone, there are plenty vying for a place in the palace: DIS? Hulu and ESPN+, Apple Inc?s (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple+, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video, Peacock, part of the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) family and AT&T Inc.?s (NYSE: T) HBO Max. Disney Earnings And Options Activity When DIS reports earnings after the close Thursday, Feb 11, consensus from third-party analysts expect the company to report a loss of $0.42 per share?versus a profit of $1.52 per share in the year-ago quarter?on revenue of $15.91 billion. That revenue figure would mark a fall of 23.7% from a year ago. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 5.1% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move? indicator on the thinkorswim? platform. View more earnings on DIS Looking at the Feb 12 options expiration, put activity has been highest at the 175 strike, but calls have seen more activity overall, with concentrations at the 190 and 200 strikes. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. DIS? DTC Impact With Hulu and ESPN+, the DTC segment?which includes its international subscriber count?accounted for some 26% of total revenue last year, marking an 81% jump on a year-over-year basis. Analysts said they expect double-digit results again as its deals with AAPL, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU) and others continue to grow. Add in those subscriber numbers and DIS has claims on 137 million subscriptions. ?The tremendous success we?ve achieved across our unique portfolio of streaming services, with more than 137 million subscriptions worldwide, has bolstered our confidence in our acceleration toward a DTC-first business model,? DIS CEO Bob Chapek said at the investor day. ?With our amazing creative teams and our ever-growing collection of the high-quality branded entertainment that consumers want, we believe we are incredibly well positioned to achieve our long-term goals,? he added. How Many Movies? Investor day seemed like a bombshell for analysts based on some of their reports afterward. The company unveiled a bounty of announcements, including its plan to release more than 100 movies and shows tied to its successful franchises such as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Marvel, National Geographic, and FX. Among the new shows on the docket are Loki, additional seasons of The Mandalorian, and Raya and The Last Dragon, and newbies such as ?Jungle Cruise,? an adventure film based on DIS? theme park of the same name. DIS is also bringing out a general entertainment content leg it?s calling Star, which will be placed on Disney+ with a Star banner in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, the company said. Those announcements helped lead to a number of upbeat analyst calls. ?Our call has been dead wrong,? Lightshed Partners analyst Richard Greenfield wrote about a month after the investor day. He noted his team ?focused on how the market under-appreciated the impact of COVID-19? on fiscal 2020?2021 earnings. ?We were simply blown away (on investor day) by the depth of content being created for Disney+ (and the financial oomph behind it). ?Increasing content spend on Disney+ to over $8 billion by 2024 compared to a target of $4 billion set just a year ago is a dramatic acceleration,? he said. No kidding. What?s Ahead Buoyed by the push into streaming, analysts said they also want to hear updates on when DIS thinks it may be back to full steam in the theme park and cruise ship businesses based on current global realities, and how the company might be tweaking the businesses to meet a higher bar of personal comfort. Theme parks are built to pack people in with crowded shows, ride queues, and resort pools. These are all logistical challenges in a socially-distant world. DIS? retail business might also be ripe for a few tweaks, as revenues from movie paraphernalia and other cross-platform marketing have fallen short and may struggle to return to the way they once were. So while the place for fun and frolic deals with the impact of COVID-19 closings and consumer hesitancy toward anything geared for crowds, DIS is leaning into streaming like never before. ?We are prioritizing our DTC platfo

Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $136.91. Sentiment: NEUTRAL Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-02-12 Strike Price: $138.00 Volume: 1404 Open Interest: 17723 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. "Out of the money" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. "Out of the money" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are "bullish" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are "bearish" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-02-09 13:10:38 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-09 13:10:38 and 2021-02-09 14:52:21+00:00: Will today be lucky seven? The S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) start off Tuesday defending six-session winning streaks, the best stretch in six months for either. The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) also hit new all-time highs yesterday. Wall Street is batting a thousand this February, to borrow a baseball term that represents perfection. The RUT is way ahead of everyone else, up 16% so far this year as investors appear focused on smaller, more domestically-oriented stocks and banks that are well represented in the index and tend to benefit from economic stimulus. See also: How to Buy Twitter (TWTR) Stock The last time the SPX started off a month as well as this was last August when it had six straight gains before faltering on day seven. Today is the seventh trading session of February, so we?ll see if the index can muster a little more power to surpass August?s mark. The day begins with major indices trending lower, so it might take a new positive catalyst to turn things around. Over the last few years, six days is about as long a winning streak as we?ve seen, so it wouldn?t be surprising if a bit of profit taking came into the market today. That kind of action?if it does happen?potentially could be a factor going into the long weekend, with markets shut Monday for Presidents Day. It was interesting to see bonds gain strength yesterday and again this morning, implying maybe a bit of a risk-off move. Tech, Social Media, And The Mouse: Earnings Shape Weekly Story Earnings began the week without too many fireworks. That changes today as Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) prepare to report after the close. CSCO is a stock that doesn?t get a lot of attention day-to-day but can be a kind of beacon for the Tech sector because it has its hands in so many different markets and products. This is a company many people watch because it can tell us so much about the economy and business spending trends, especially now as things reopen. TWTR?s call could be interesting for more insight into its recent bans, along with user trends. Looking ahead to later this week, some of the big names include Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), tomorrow and Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) on Thursday. Analysts say they?ll be looking for updated numbers on the Disney+ streaming service, as well as the latest on when DIS thinks it may be back to full steam in the theme park and cruise ship businesses based on current global realities. The stock has been on a roll, helped by the company?s investor day back in December that appeared to wow much of Wall Street. We?ve been in an ?earnings recession,? defined by corporate profits posting year-over-year declines for two quarters in a row. That seems to be ending with Q4 earnings, MarketWatch reported. It notes that S&P 500 companies are now projected to show positive earnings growth of 1.7% for Q4, with 58% of results already in. There?s still a ways to go, but the numbers point in the right direction, helped by firm results from the Financial and Tech sectors, according to FactSet research. In the long run, earnings drive the market, so that helps explain what this rally is in response to. There?s data ahead, too, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January out tomorrow morning. In December, the overall CPI rose 0.4% while the ?core? CPI that strips out food and energy rose 0.1%. Analysts expect another 0.4% rise in January overall and 0.2% for the core, Briefing.com said. Those kinds of numbers probably wouldn?t ring too many inflation alarm bells, but with Treasury yields generally rising and energy costs gaining steam, any higher than expected CPI data could draw a raised eyebrow or two. The new week began like a repeat of the previous one. Cyclical sectors like Energy and Financials, along with small-caps, kept gaining ground while mega-caps and FAANGs stepped back. The Tech sector wasn?t a complete washout, however. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gained more than 3%. Stimulus hopes and a decent earnings season appear to be driving cyclicals higher. It?s good to see more companies sharing guidance, although many are still reluctant to guide for the full year. In general, it doesn?t look like most companies expect earnings to fall apart this year, and it also might have been a boost to sentiment when Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) decided not to cut its dividend despite all the pain suffered by the Energy sector over the last year. Tracking Retail Investors In January Retail investors came out of the gate swinging, so to speak, in January. TD Ameritrade?s Investor Movement Index? (IMXSM) increased to 6.91 in January, up about 10.4% from its December score of 6.26. The IMX is TD Ameritrade?s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets. January was a month dominated by major news stories, from government stimulus to a change of power in D.C. to the start of earnings season. Then it finished with some unparalleled volatility in stocks such as GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Theatres Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC). It also arguably marked the first month in almost a year where COVID wasn?t the primary day-to-day story. Investors tracked by the IMX had 10% more exposure to the market in January than in the previous month, the biggest leap in a long time. As you would suspect, TDA clients traded good amounts of GME and AMC, but a bit more AMC, perhaps because of the lower price point. Because these two stocks only traded heavily in the last week of the month, they didn?t have as big an effect on overall January activity. The top-three ?net buys? tracked by the IMX in January were Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), while Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) led the ?net-sell? list. Why would vaccine makers PFE and MRNA be on the wrong side of the ledger, shall we say? The reason might be that although the great news on vaccines was a huge step for fighting the pandemic, at the end of the day some investors might have been looking for what kind of catalyst could take them to the next step as their stocks leveled out a bit. CHART OF THE DAY: DAVID BEATING GOLIATH. Over the last three months, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX?purple line) had a nice run, rising about 16%. But the NDX, which includes many of the so-called ?mega-cap? stocks, is way behind the small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT?candlestick) since early November. The RUT is up around 34% during that stretch as investors pile into smaller companies perhaps best situated to benefit from economic stimulus and reopening. Data Sources: Nasdaq, FTSE Russell. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Yield Watch: After hitting 2% for the first time in about a year, 30-year bond yields walked back a bit late Monday. The 10-year yield also retreated after touching a new one-year high of 1.2%. Neither of these numbers is really in thin air (the all-time low 10-year yield before last year was around 1.4%), but the yield rally that?s gaining steam amid talk of a stimulus should probably be in the back of your mind as an investor. Right now, close to 70% of stocks pay a dividend that?s higher than the 10-year Treasury. That percentage is very close to a record high. However, if rates rise to 1.75%, that proportion drops to 44%, Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian said in an interview with Barron?s. Many investors are retirees looking for income. It?s not a given that yields can rise back to 1.75% this year (some analysts look for 1.4% to 1.5%), but it?s hard not to argue that as yields rise, fixed income could start looking more attractive than stocks to some investors. The big growth stocks, biotechs, an

What Happened: Super Bowl LV featuring the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs had an average of 96.4 million viewers on television and streaming platforms, according to Nielsen. The viewership hit a 13-year low, down 9% from last year?s Super Bowl average of 102 million viewers. Ten of the last 11 Super Bowls had viewership of over 100 million. The previous low from the last ten years was 98.2 million in 2019. The good news in the ratings figures were the streaming viewership, which hit a record. Super Bowl LV was the most live-streamed NFL contest ever with 5.7 million viewers on average, according to Axios. Streaming viewership was up 65% from last year?s Super Bowl. Related Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Tom Brady Why It?s Important: The results are an estimate of the average viewership during Super Bowl LV. This year?s game may have been tough to provide data for with restaurants and bars not airing the game and it being harder to track how many people were watching in each household. The game resulted in a blowout with the Buccaneers winning 31-9 and viewership typically fades if the game isn't close. A close game can result in more viewers tuning in late in the second half if they weren?t watching previously. The Super Bowl shows that when it comes to ratings, a competitive game matters more than any other factor. This game was the second biggest Super Bowl blowout in the last 18 years, per the CBS release. ? John Ourand (@Ourand_SBJ) February 9, 2021 Streaming data from Sportico?s Eben Novy-Williams shows that the streaming figures could help several companies that had a strong share of the game. Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) led the way with 41% and 24% share, respectively, of streaming viewership. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) had a 12% share for streaming with its AppleTV. Samsung ranked fourth with a share of 8%. Video game services from Sony Corp (NYSE: SNE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) each had 4% market share. Impact On CBS: The 91.6 million viewers could be a disappointment for ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ: VIAC), but the company will still see a windfall of revenue from the low viewed Super Bowl. Thirty-second commercials commanded a record $5.5 million for the big game. ViacomCBS was also able to promote its upcoming streaming service Paramount+ during the big game, which could lead to strong initial reception and brand awareness.

Apple plans to launch the VR headset in 2022 and it may pave the way for sales of augmented reality glasses, according to Bloomberg. Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 0.7% lower at $136.01 on Tuesday.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) Car project continues to heat the market, although not directly the Apple stock. For some time, the Cupertino company has been working on a fully autonomous electric car, but it doesn?t seem to have found the right partner among car manufacturers so far. Apple-Hyundai Deal Is Off: Until a few days ago, the agreement with Hyundai Motor Company Ltd. (OTC: HYMTF) seemed like a done deal. The South Korean company - after the first successful approaches last January - was ready to make the Kia plant in West Point (Georgia) available to Apple, but some days ago the process came to a screeching halt, apparently due to internal disagreements within the Hyundai board. See also: How To Buy Apple Stock Speculations On Renault: However, Apple has plenty of options. With the Hyundai-Kia hypothesis fading out, a possible partnership with Renault ADR (OTC: RNLSY) seems to be gaining ground, with the French automaker being an ally of other major Asian car manufacturers such as Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (OTC: NSANY) and Mitsubishi. Apple's goal would be to strike an agreement with an Asian company, probably to intercept the (potential) endless electric car market in the continent. Renault Stock On The Rise: After rumors of a possible deal with Renault - the automaker which manufactures Zoe, one of the best-selling electric cars in the world - the French automaker's shares spiked yesterday, rising again above $40, which Renault hadn?t reached since December 2019. However, shared dropped 2% today, perhaps due to a lack of confirmation or just for some profit-taking. See Also: Why Apple Could Emerge As Tesla's 'First True Competitor' Time Until 2024: "We are receiving several requests for cooperation in the joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies, but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided," Hyundai executives said in a note in which they dismissed the deal with Apple. In conclusion, the Apple Car will have to wait for now: there is time until 2024, which is the expected release date.

2021-02-10 12:55:21 AAPL.TiingoNews article description at 2021-02-10 12:55:21 and 2021-02-10 14:39:26+00:00: We?re almost a month into earnings season and the hits just keep on coming. LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UAA), and Yelp Inc (NYSE: YELP) all joined the fun last night and this morning, giving the market an early boost after yesterday?s retreat. These companies generally topped analysts? estimates and, maybe more importantly, shared positive views about their businesses and the economy. Phrases like ?confidence in returning to growth? and ?encouraging signs of strength? are good to see in the press releases of reporting companies at times like these. That doesn?t mean all the news was good, and keep in mind some of the earnings achievements came through cost-cutting, not growing the business. Also, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) struggled in pre-market trading today despite topping estimates. In this case, it?s a bit like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) earlier this quarter, with investors punishing the stock because they apparently expected even better. Never mind. The results looked strong and so did the company?s outlook. We?re not done yet. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) later today could give us an inside view at how the economy is emerging from COVID-19. MGM shares have been on a roll lately, maybe on hopes of things returning to normal and more people booking vacations. In a sign that maybe some of the risk-on sentiment remains, Treasury yields popped back up this morning after a two-day retreat. The question is whether the 10-year yield can claw above 1.2% and stay there, something that it hasn?t achieved in this rally. Powell Time This Afternoon Fed Chairman Jerome Powell takes the mic at 2 p.m. ET today when he makes a speech called, ?State of the U.S. Labor Market.? It?s part of a webinar put on by the Economic Club of New York. While the topic means it?s unlikely Powell will discuss interest rates, maybe he?ll provide more detail on some of the remarks he made at the January Fed meeting. That?s when he said the ?pace of the labor market has slowed in recent months.? It could be a chance to hear him talk more about why that?s the case and how quickly he thinks the situation could reverse. Obviously, a lot of that is beyond the Fed?s control?mainly because the virus, its variants, and the pace of vaccinations keep making the calls. What could be interesting is if he talks about the developing fiscal stimulus plan and its possible effects on labor. It?s unclear if he?ll take questions, but if there is a Q&A it?s possible someone might ask him about the Democrats? proposal to raise the minimum wage and what impact he thinks that might have. No guarantee there, of course. Win Streak Fizzles Out There?s no rule saying the market has to be exciting every day. Which is good, because yesterday was one of those forgettable sessions where things just didn?t happen. It felt like some consolidation took place ahead of today?s inflation data and Powell?s speech. At the same time, profit-taking pressure hasn?t shown up in a big way, which might reflect people being reluctant to exit too many long positions amid all the optimism around stimulus, vaccination, and improved earnings. That old saying, ?Don?t fight the Fed? could also be playing a role. Still, the six-day win streak for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) didn?t extend to a lucky seven on Tuesday, which may disappoint people who watch stuff like that. There may be a little fatigue developing at these high levels, and there haven?t been a lot of exciting new catalysts this week to entice more buyers. That being said, the market has been pricing in the reopening optimism, and in the short term that may be able to keep us grinding higher. What?s a bit worrisome is whether the reality of the economy can live up to the expectations. The expectations are just so high that you wonder when we get there, what?s next. That could be the feeling that led to some retreat yesterday in reopening stocks, including a bunch of the airlines, cruise lines, and casinos that had been helping things rally. The airline rally appears to be based on hopes for summer travel to pick up, because there?s not much travel at the moment. The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) daily U.S. checkpoint data shows average airport passenger flow is still well under half of where it was a year ago before the pandemic. That holiday surge just didn?t last. Taking A Lyft Ahead Of Uber Earnings It?s actually hard to find wider patterns so far this week, which means individual earnings may provide more insight than following the indices. Overall, Q4 earnings generally keep getting better (see more below). LYFT got the ride-sharing segment off to a nice start yesterday, even though it still posted a big net loss for 2020. Average revenue per rider hit a record high, and the company reiterated that it expects to have a profitable quarter on an adjusted basis by the end of this year. Shares rose double-digits in the pre-market hours. Later today the focus turns to UBER, which has been able to make a little hay during the pandemic with its food delivery business. No surprise there, really, with so many people ordering in. Inflation Data, And A Look Ahead Until this morning, there hadn?t been much data this week. That changed with the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) being released. Not much drama there, with a 0.3% rise right in line with expectations and down just a bit from 0.4% in December. Core CPI actually came in flat, compared with analysts? average estimate for 0.2%. If Powell talks about inflation in his speech today, this report doesn?t provide much hope of getting back to the Fed?s 2% target anytime soon. The rest of the week has plenty of earnings action but not much data. One worry is that stock prices may be getting a bit ahead of the economy. Recent data have been all over the map, but don?t all point upward. For every positive report (ISM manufacturing) there seems to be another data point you can say was negative (January employment). CHART OF THE DAY: SECTOR RENEWAL. The Financial (IXM?candlestick) and Energy (IXE?purple line) sectors had underperformed the broader market for months before catching some bids starting back in November, as this three-month chart shows. Analysts say both sectors have continued to see positive asset flow recently, though Tuesday was a tough day for Energy. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim? platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Disney vs. Other Streamers: Tomorrow afternoon brings fiscal Q1 earnings from Disney (DIS), and the Disney+ streaming business is squarely in the spotlight. With only one birthday under its belt, Disney+ was reaching 86.8 million subscribers as of Dec. 2, the company reported at its investor day. That was up nearly 20% from the 73 million subscriber base as of the end of its fiscal Q4. Analysts will likely be listening tomorrow or fresh numbers, and comparing the trajectory to internal forecasts that see the base tripling by 2024?to a jaw-dropping level of between 230 million and 260 million subscribers. DIS executives have also said they plan to up the price a buck to $7.99 per month. Though Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) is arguably the king of streaming services that DIS hopes to dethrone, there are plenty vying for a place in the palace: DIS? Hulu and ESPN+, Apple Inc?s (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple+, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video, Peacock, part of the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) family and AT&T Inc.?s (NYSE: T) HBO Max. Tracking Claims: No single data point is a trend, but how about three? That?s how many weeks in a row new weekly jobless claims have dropped going into tomorrow morning?s weekly jobless claims report. They hit 927,000 a few weeks ago, and then descended the stairway to 875,000, 812,000, and finally last week?s 779,000. These aren?t good numbers by any stretch of the

Twitter reported adjusted EPS of 38 cents on revenue of $1.29 billion. Both numbers beat consensus analyst forecasts of 31 cents and $1.19 billion, respectively. Revenue was up 28% from a year ago. Twitter reported 192 million monetizable daily active users, missing analyst expectations of 193.5 million. Looking ahead, Twitter guided for first-quarter revenue of between $940 million and $1.04 billion.

Now that rumored discussions with Hyundai Motor Company (PINK: HYMTF) and its subsidiary Kia Motors Corp. about building an electric vehicle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been put on hold, we asked Benzinga readers which automaker the tech giant?s self-driving EV research and development team would be best served to partner with on the project. Who should Apple partner with to make a self-driving electric vehicle? Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) About 37% of traders and investors believe a Tesla-Apple EV partnership makes the most sense. Many respondents noted Elon Musk's company is the most established EV automaker and would be the easiest for Apple to partner with, given its EV line up features the longest distance electric cars between charges, the company?s laid out plans for installing EV chargers throughout the U.S. and at-present has the largest EV market share. About 32% of respondents believe a Ford-Apple partnership would be the best fit for Apple, many citing Ford?s worldwide footprint as an automaker and praise for Ford's brand new EV offering, the Mustang Mach-E SUV. Ford has about 14% market of the automotive share in the U.S. and about 7% share in Europe. Lastly, 31% percent of respondents said GM would be the best fit for Apple's EV project. Respondents cited GM's recently announced commitment that it plans eliminating all gas- and diesel-powered cars from its lineup by 2035, shifting to electric vehicles, and the fact that GM is the country's largest automaker, commanding a 17% market share as the reasons why Apple ought to carry out their EV vision with the Detroit automaker. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in February 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 1,000 adults.
