143,2021-01-06 13:05:15," investors woke up to an unfamiliar sight wednesday: the 10-year treasury yield is back above 1% for the first time since last march.yields rocketed higher while stocks looked mixed as democrats took one georgia senate seat and led narrowly in the other georgia senate race with thousands of votes left to count. strength in yields could reflect ideas that if democrats do gain ground, another fiscal stimulus and increased washington spending could grow more likely.all this is speculation, and no one should be thinking that anything--including the makeup of the senate as well as new policy priorities--is a done deal. we'll know at some point who won, so let's focus on what's happening right now.there's the 10-month high in 10-year yields, obviously, and crude hit an 11-month high above $50 a barrel. that happened after saudi arabia surprised everyone with a voluntary one million barrel-per-day production cut, according to media reports. the jump in yields appeared to strengthen financial shares including bank of america corp (nyse: bac) and jpmorgan chase & co. (nyse: jpm). back at home, the nasdaq 100 (ndx) is taking it on the chin as some of the big stocks there like amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn), microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) and apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) come under pressure in premarket trading. why? well, if it's a 50-50 senate (with a democratic tie-breaker), there's concern about more regulation on the tech sector.at the same time, financial stocks and the russell 2000 index (rut) of small-caps are up early on. these parts of the market could get a shot in the arm from higher rates and stimulus hopes if democrats do extend their lead. banks benefit from higher rates because it tends to help their profit margins, while the rut is more exposed to the domestic economy than other indices and also has a big population of regional bank stocks. more government spending (if there's another stimulus) would likely help keep yields elevated.in the world of individual stocks, some that might benefit from democratic control include solar energy companies and electric cars. tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) shares climbed in pre-market trading, and so did shares of a bunch of solar firms. you could make a bullish case for either side winning. the bullish case for democrats is more short-term (the chance for more stimulus), but a republican victory might be longer-term bullish if it leads to more washington spending discipline.trading could be choppy today as investors watch the votes roll in. it's kind of interesting, though, to see the cboe volatility index (vix) a little lower this morning after it flirted with 30 earlier this week. keep an eye on that if a final call gets made in georgia.turnaround tuesday as peach state votes after starting the year with a selloff, the market turned things around tuesday thanks in part to leadership from the small-cap rut and so-called ""value"" sectors like energy and financials. the rut outpaced every other major index, gaining nearly 2% after a 2020 that saw it recover from early weakness to have a better year than the large-cap s&p 500 index (spx).a selloff in bonds yesterday might have gotten the party started both for financials and the rut (which has a large contingent of regional banks among its leading stocks). the market wavered and drifted up until early afternoon, and then saw a buying wave come in that lifted almost all the sectors.some decent data might have helped too, especially ism manufacturing (see more below). the election was on investors' minds, and it's interesting to see how small-caps--which tend to be more sensitive to domestic fiscal policy--rallied tuesday as voting took place.what else is happening? earnings reports, payrolls data ahead beyond the election and yesterday's rally, this week is packed with data and even a few earnings reports.tomorrow, investors are expecting to hear from bed, bath & beyond inc. (nasdaq: bbby), micron technology, inc. (nasdaq: mu), conagra brands inc (nyse: cag), and walgreens boots alliance inc (nasdaq: wba). all three of these firms have direct consumer exposure. don't know what cag sells? think about a bunch of stuff that might be in your pantry, including slim jims, duncan hines, hunts', and vlasic. yep, tomorrow we'll get a better sense of how meat sticks, canned tomatoes, pickles, and cake mixes performed in cag's most recent quarter, and this is one of those rare companies whose stock has pretty much flatlined over the last year.that can't be said for wba, one of the worst performers of 2020 and a prominent one because it's listed in the dow jones industrial average ($dji). it was the second-worst performer in the $dji last year after finishing last in 2019. the company's been hurt by more people getting prescriptions delivered by mail, which means fewer people coming in and browsing at stores. some analysts think the stock has gotten oversold and may be able to top wall street's estimates. we shall see.data-wise, the week kicked off with a really nice read on december ism manufacturing, which came in well above analysts' expectations tuesday at 60.7%. that topped november's 57.5%, and was way above wall street's average estimate of 56.4%. believe it or not, the headline figure is now just 10 basis points below the recent high of 60.8% recorded in 2018, briefing.com pointed out. anything above 50% shows expansion, and manufacturing data often points toward future demand from businesses and consumers. this looks like a green shoot after some disappointing data over the last few weeks.the big number this week is nonfarm payrolls--arguably the most closely-watched number each month--due out ahead of the bell friday. see below for more insight into what that important report might show.something else to watch could be this new strain of virus reported recently in south africa. it's still early, but some scientists are worried about how it will respond to vaccines. just keep in mind that if scientists do determine it's less responsive, that could make for some ugliness in the markets. obviously there's no reason to panic, but just another uncertainty to factor into your thinking.chart of the day: crude sputtering at $50. will there be enough momentum to push crude oil futures (/cl--candlestick) above $50 (yellow horizontal line) per barrel? if there is, there is potential for further upside movement perhaps to the high of $54.66, the high reached in february 2020. if /cl doesn't break above $50, it could fall back within its $47-$48 trading range. data source: cme group. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results.thanks for the raise: the new year brings higher pay for many, as 20 states raised their minimum wages on jan. 1. the debate has raged for decades and probably will continue about whether doing this helps or hurts workers, businesses, and the economy. also, with the pandemic raging and numerous shutdowns, it's going to be hard to see an immediate impact. some might argue that it could present an additional burden on small businesses, for that matter.still, if vaccinations get things back on a more normal footing and local shops and restaurants see some recovery, rising wages could put extra dollars in employees' pockets, helping consumer demand down the road. the biggest minimum wage increase is in new mexico, where it goes from $9 to $10.50. the corollary to this is high levels of consumer debt after the holiday season, which has some economists worried. if consumers are looking at empty pocketbooks as they try to pay their holiday bills, spending levels could get muted in coming weeks. watch your wallet: investors expecting an economic recovery often turn to the consumer discretionary sector, hoping shoppers will feel more spending power. since last june--with data generally improving from the virus-related lows--consumer discretionary improved too. it rose almost 26%, beating all but two other s&p 500 sectors over that time frame. thi

144,2021-01-06 13:22:23," in a surprising turn of events, democrats appear poised to take over control of the senate, potentially setting up at least two years of full democratic control in washington.what happened? on tuesday, georgia held two senate runoff elections. as of wednesday morning, democrat rev. raphael warnock is the projected victor in one of the two georgia senate runoff races, while democrat jon ossoff maintains a narrow lead in a second race that is still too close to call with an estimated 98% of the votes already tallied at publication time.why it's important: online prediction market predictit now estimates democrats have a 97% chance of gaining control of the senate. two democratic victories in georgia would split the senate 50-50 with vice president-elect kamala harris getting the tie-breaking vote.analysts and experts say democratic control of the white house, senate and house of representatives would be great news for the democratic agenda, but democrats will have zero wiggle room on more progressive legislation.in the near-term, president-elect joe biden has reportedly said senate control would potentially allow him to make more progressive cabinet picks.investor impact: two areas in which investors could see a positive impact from a democratic victory could be cannabis stocks and clean energy stocks. cantor fitzgerald analyst pablo zuanic said democratic control of the senate could be a ""game changer"" for cannabis stocks.""we go from speculating what president-elect biden could have done for cannabis reform via executive order (or by directives/'memos' from his incoming attorney general) and if the senate would have held a vote on the safe act (banking reform) would have even taken a vote, to a new world, in which the question is more about the timing and scope of much broader reform for the cannabis industry,"" zuanic wrote in a note this week.he said trulieve cannabis corp (otc: tcnnf) and curaleaf holdings inc (otc: curlf) remain his top two stock picks among u.s. multi-state operators.wedbush analyst daniel ives said the outcome in georgia could be great news for electric vehicle stocks and bad news for big tech stocks.""to be blunt, it's a clear negative for big tech as ultimately with a senate now likely controlled by democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around faang names with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table,"" ives wrote in a note.shares of facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb), amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn), apple inc. (nasdaq: aapl) and other target tech stocks initially traded lower by more than 2% on wednesday morning.ives said ev stocks like tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla), general motors company (nyse: gm) and fisker inc (nyse: fsr) have a lot to gain from the democratic sweep.""we believe a doubling down on ev tax credits and further consumer incentives and government initiatives around the ev sector will be on the horizon which is a major positive for tesla, gm, fisker, and other auto players/ev supply chain (qs, etc.),"" ives said.all three stocks opened higher on wednesday morning.benzinga's take: wall street initially appeared to see more overall negatives to a democratic victory than positives, likely due to concerns over higher taxes and a potential increase in regulation. the spdr s&p 500 etf trust (nyse: spy) opened wednesday's session down about 0.5%, but was trading in positive territory at publication time.see more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * 4 reasons the stock market rally could resume in 2021  * s&p 500 has only been this expensive one other time ? at the peak of the dot-com bubble(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

(nyse: tsm) and samsung electronics co ltd (otc: ssnlf) to outsource partial chip production after delays in its chip fabrication processes, bloomberg reports.what happened: intel had reported problems with its 7-nanometer chip manufacturing process in july 2020 and announced a delay in the rollout of its next-generation chips to 2022, 2023. the company had said it was considering outsourcing some of its chip manufacturing.intel's ceo bob swan has promised investors that he would set out outsourcing plans by jan. 21, when it reports earnings. swan said he would get the company's production technology back on track.though intel is the world's best-known chipmaker, it has suffered years-long delays that have put it behind competitors that design their own chips and outsource production to companies like taiwan semiconductor.why it matters: rivals such as advanced micro devices inc. (nasdaq: amd) and apple inc. (nasdaq: aapl) have raced ahead with their own designs and tsmc's advanced production technology, bloomberg notes.""we have another great lineup of products in 2022, and i'm increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes, or a combination of both,"" swan said in october 2020. tsmc is the largest maker of semiconductors for other companies. it has offered to prepare intel chips manufactured using a 4-nanometer process, with initial testing using an older 5-nanometer process, bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.tsmc will make 4-nanometer chips test production by the fourth quarter of 2021 and volume shipments by next year. as intel keeps manufacturing its best semiconductors in-house, any outsourcing of this scale will require a potential supplier to create new capacity.samsung is the world's biggest producer of memory chips and a competitor to tsmc. it has to look for big contracts for its foundry unit, the financial times reports.bernstein analysts estimated intel might outsource 10-30% of its cpu production in 2023 to tsmc, which would boost the latter's revenue by 5% to 10%. ""samsung may get a minor share in this business,"" but tsmc technology is ahead of samsung's ""with better execution,"" the bernstein analysts said. price action: on the last check monday, intc shares are up 0.90% at $52.11, tsm shares are up by 3.09% at $122.36.see more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * samsung picks early launch for flagship galaxy s smartphones(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

361,2021-01-11 13:39:20," apple (nasdaq:aapl) shares experienced unusual options activity on monday. the stock price moved down to $129.62 following the option alert.  * sentiment: bullish  * option type: sweep  * trade type: put  * expiration date: 2021-01-22  * strike price: $128.00  * volume: 2862  * open interest: 4026three indications of unusual options activity one way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. the volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. the number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. a contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.bullish and bearish sentiments options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. the activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. for the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.using these strategies to trade options unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.for more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertssee more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * 10 information technology stocks with unusual options alerts in today's session  * 10 information technology stocks showing unusual options activity in today's session(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

487,2021-01-14 13:16:38," today's one of those days that's kind of a ""transition day,"" if you will. it's the unofficial kickoff of earnings season before the official one tomorrow, and everyone's waiting for president-elect biden's economic speech. with so much waiting in the wings, it's likely the market will trade like it has the last few days, without much conviction. the good news is that the unofficial earnings kickoff with delta air lines, inc. (nyse: dal) and blackrock, inc. (nyse: blk) got us off to a good start. dal shares crept higher in pre-market trading not because its results looked all that great, necessarily, but because the company seems to be doing a decent job managing through this challenging situation. it halved the amount of cash it's burning through each day even as it operates with revenue down 65% from a year earlier. all the airlines are still works in progress for now, and dal said 2020 was the toughest year in its history. it also said it expects to have more access to capital and return to profitability in 2021. financials were another sector that suffered last year but seem to generally be in better shape now. asset manager blk shares bounced this morning before the bell as the company reported better than expected assets under management and a higher than expected quarterly profit. blk's results--which partially reflect lively financial markets in q4--could bode well for some of the big banks that report tomorrow and next week. it looks like the rest of the financial sector might be getting some early spillover support from blk's nice quarter. later today, keep an eye out for fed chairman jerome powell, who's scheduled to appear at a livestream event at 12:30 p.m. et. it's unclear exactly what might come up for discussion, but it's always possible he could say something market moving. the market didn't move much on this morning's disappointing weekly jobless claims data, which rose to a five-month high of 965,000. this stubborn indicator just refuses to come down, speaking to more suffering around the economy. it's been mostly around 800,000 recently, so we'll soon find out if today's data is a one-time piece of bad news or something even worse. impeachment appears to leave wall street unfazed stocks bounced around wednesday with attention diverted toward impeachment for the second time in a little over a year. the swirl of events in washington over the last week--including the impeachment vote--could raise uncertainty levels on wall street, which is never a good thing for the market. at the same time, there's a different dynamic playing out this time vs. when the same thing happened in late 2019 and early 2020. today, the market is balancing what impeachment might mean even as a new administration is coming in and raising hopes for fresh stimulus. the stock market generally moved higher a year ago when the first impeachment was underway before being kneecapped by the arrival of covid-19. stocks also did relatively well back in 1998-99 when congress was impeaching president bill clinton. generally, it feels like everything is on pause for the moment at the cusp of earnings season and inauguration. having next monday as a holiday just adds to the sense that big moves aren't likely. volatility has swung back and forth in a pretty small range since a quick climb to start the week. once earnings begin in a major way and the new president is inaugurated--and after impeachment is resolved one way or another--it might get wall street back to a more normal sense of rhythm. that is, if anything could be considered normal when the pandemic continues to sink its claws into the economy and peoples' lives. start making sense sometimes things get out of sync on wall street, but other times they click along like clockwork. wednesday was kind of a clockwork day, meaning some of the closely watched metrics behaved the way you might expect them to. for instance, treasury yields pulled back and so did small-cap stocks, while tech stocks rallied. this is what you might expect, because rising yields tend to help small-caps by reflecting expectations of a stronger domestic economy. tech stocks had been playing defense earlier this week as yields rose and had investors worried about earnings being squeezed by higher interest rates, but found buyers wednesday on a day when the 10-year yield fell to 1.09%. it had peaked near a 10-month high of close to 1.19% earlier in the week. the drop in yields also made sense if you consider the mild inflation data released early wednesday. core consumer prices rose just 0.1% in december, which was below some analysts' expectations. year-over-year core prices were up 1.2% for the third-straight month. not only is that well below the fed's 2% goal, it's also a level that pretty much squelched a lot of the inflation talk that was circulating around the market earlier in the week and helping spike treasury yields. obviously, that doesn't mean the yield rally is over and it's clear sailing ahead on inflation worries. some investors think yields might get a lift over the coming month or two as the new administration settles in and starts legislating. president-elect joe biden is expected to present his economic stimulus plan today and many investors will look closely to see how much money they're talking. some estimates ahead of the announcement were as high as $2 trillion. if any of this money is directed into infrastructure programs or direct payments to people who are struggling, that could have a multiplier effect that helps stimulate growth but also could stimulate a bit of inflation. the fed meeting later this month could provide investors a chance to get monetary policy makers' viewpoint on how inflationary the plan might be, but there's no indication that the fed has any thoughts of pulling back its own stimulus anytime in the shorter term.there's more talk among economists that the fed could start tapering the bond-buying aspect of its program perhaps by early next year if the pandemic situation is a lot better by then. the fed has also promised to give plenty of notice long before it starts tapering, probably an attempt on its part to avoid a market ""taper tantrum"" like we saw back in 2013. major indices may be hitting the ""pause"" button in the long rally this week, but remain just below all-time highs. the faangs, including apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn), and netflix inc (nasdaq: nflx) rebounded wednesday after getting sent to the woodshed earlier this week. many of these tech and communications firms are approaching their earnings dates, meaning enthusiasm could be building as investors anticipate results. a strong initial read on christmas sales from target corporation (nyse: tgt) this week could be raising expectations ahead of amzn and aapl, both of which have heavy consumer exposure. more on consumer activity below. speaking of tech, intel corporation (nasdaq: intc) shares got a big boost yesterday when its ceo announced plans to step down. many investors have gotten frustrated with the chip company amid production issues, and sometimes new leadership can provide fresh perspective and new ideas of how to run things. despite that, underlying problems don't go away just because a new person moves into the corner office. boeing co (nyse: ba) replaced its ceo midway through the 737 max crisis, but the stock still hasn't come close to recovering all its losses. it might help in this case that intc's incoming ceo pat gelsinger is a company veteran known for his technical knowledge. it would probably be a lot harder for someone without experience at intc to quickly get a handle on the specific issues intc faces.chart of the day: dollar's decline gives crude an assist. this three month chart of the dollar index ($dxy--candlestick) vs. crude (/cl--purple line) shows how softness in the dollar has coincided with a sharp rally for crude. this is something that's common, but the question is whether this crude rally has any momentum left now that the dollar seems to be bouncing off its

488,2021-01-14 13:55:52," apple (nasdaq:aapl) shares experienced unusual options activity on thursday. the stock price moved down to $130.01 following the option alert.  * sentiment: bullish  * option type: sweep  * trade type: call  * expiration date: 2021-01-15  * strike price: $130.00  * volume: 36871  * open interest: 106128three signs of unusual options activity extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. the number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. a contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.bullish and bearish sentiments options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. an observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. for the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.using these strategies to trade options unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.for more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertssee more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * 10 information technology stocks showing unusual options activity in today's session  * 10 information technology stocks showing unusual options activity in today's session(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

510,2021-01-15 06:45:17," the outgoing president donald trump's administration continues to add pressure on china even as its term nears an end. in the latest move, u.s. has added china's leading smartphone maker xiaomi corp (otc: xiacf) and its third-biggest driller cnooc ltd (nyse: ceo) to blacklisted firms -- baning them from american investment due to ties with the chinese military, bloomberg reported on thursday.what happened: xiaomi was added to the department of defense (dod) list of nine companies for alleged military ties. ""the department is determined to highlight and counter the people's republic of china's (prc) military-civil fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the people's liberation army (pla) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those prc companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities,"" dod said in a statement.companies in the dod list are prohibited from american exchanges and investment. as per the administration's amended order, investors have a november 2021 deadline to sell sanctioned securities.cnooc was added to the department of commerce (doc) list -- which denies access to u.s. technologies for the driller without specific permission. bloomberg noted that the list is under an order issued in december that has blacklisted more than 60 companies.""china's reckless and belligerent actions in the south china sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarization efforts are a threat to u.s. national security and the security of the international community,"" commerce secretary wilbur ross said in a press release.""cnooc acts as a bully for the people's liberation army to intimidate china's neighbors, and the chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes.""why it matters: xiaomi's stock crashed 10% in hong kong on the news. the company hit back by saying ""it provides products and services for civilian and commercial use.""""the company confirms that it is not owned, controlled, or affiliated with the chinese military, and is not a 'communist chinese military company' defined under the ndaa,"" xiaomi said in a statement, as per cnbc.xiaomi is the third-largest smartphone maker globally, and this move could have future implications, cnbc notes. the smartphone has not been put on the ""entity list,"" which bans sanctioned companies from using american technology. xiaomi uses chips from qualcomm, inc. (nasdaq: qcom).as per the bloomberg report, the move against xiaomi was unexpected, which is viewed as china's answer to apple inc (nasdaq: aapl). unless the ban is reversed, xiaomi risks being delisted from u.s. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes.so far, the government has left three major companies -- alibaba group holding ltd (nyse: baba), tencent holdings (otc: tcehy), and baidu inc (nasdaq: bidu) off the ban list considering the potential economic impact.price action: xiacf closed 9.35% lower at $3.88 on thursday, and ceo closed 5.02% higher at $102.71.related news: top us banks to remove hong kong-listed products with exposure to sanctioned chinese companiesphoto courtesy: ilya plekhanov on wikimediasee more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * trump administration issues new order clarifying investment ban against chinese companies  * amazon follows twitter in removing qanon related products(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

599,2021-01-17 07:45:58," blackberry limited (bb) is somewhat of an enigma in the investment world, full of great promise but at the same time, it has let shareholders down time and again. the company is armed with a huge patent portfolio, and offers several cutting-edge products in cybersecurity, internet-of-things (iot), and automotive technology. what?s more, shares have surged 32% in the last two sessions after blackberry announced that it has sold 90 smartphone technology patents to huawei, as part of its shift away from the mobile phone space. but while blackberry gushes with potential, it also disappoints quarter after quarter. in the most recent quarter, blackberry missed on revenue and gaap eps. most concerning were the drop in revenue, down 20% year-over-year, and the sizeable increase in gaap operating loss of $127 million, up from the $29 million loss one year ago. to be fair, some of the performance issues were pandemic-related, particularly with regards to the auto sector where plant shutdowns have translated to fewer automobile deliveries, and hence, lower qnx licensing fees. however, the company?s revenue has been shrinking for several years before the pandemic. the five-year growth rate for example is -20.8%. company transformation the story is not all bad. glimmers of hope are emerging in what may yet shape up to be a multi-year turnaround story that started in 2013, the year that john chen took the reigns of blackberry as ceo. at that time, blackberry was a $6 billion titanic, immersed in red ink after hitting an iceberg called the apple iphone. after taking charge, john chen proceeded to monetize the company?s patent portfolio, and transform the mobile phone manufacturer into a much more modest $1 billion software company. the transformation has taken place over several years, with half a dozen acquisitions along the way, including cylance, good, and athoc. these companies have been assimilated and worked into blackberry's product streams, but also have resulted in a significant write down of goodwill, including $500 million earlier in 2020. blackberry has at least stabilized its financial situation, and now has positive free cash flow and adjusted ebitda. that said, the turmoil surrounding the company has affected its stock price and resulted in an attractive valuation. blackberry also boasts some promising technologies that could lead to strong revenue growth down the road. this may be a great time to invest in blackberry. valuation metrics blackberry?s low valuation should come as no surprise given its past troubles. the company has superior metrics versus the software industry on a number of fronts, summarized in the table below. metricblackberryindustryprice/sales ratio5.8511.31price/book ratio3.0711.44gross margin74.2%70.9%operating margin-9.2%-23.6%current ratio2.271.57total debt/equity0.330.55 metrics such as price/sales and price/book ratio suggest that blackberry is quite undervalued, with a strong likelihood that the stock will outperform once the company?s future potential is recognized by the market. it is not at all unreasonable to expect a 2x - 3x stock price increase from its current level. blackberry ivy blackberry?s recent announcement regarding its strategic alliance with amazon web services (aws) may be enough to kick-start the company?s stock price. the exclusive partnership provides instant credibility along with a ?big data? mindset to vehicle data, resulting in unlimited potential for third-party applications in areas such as car insurance, maintenance, ev charging, and connected vehicles. the aws platform gives blackberry ivy cloud-connectivity, scalability, and a global reach. this initiative will provide blackberry with a new source of recurring revenue in the automotive market, where it already has software installed in over 175 million cars. spark suite apart from blackberry ivy, there are several other promising technologies emerging from blackberry, including spark suite, which combines endpoint management with endpoint security, a logical step in the evolution of mobile devices. spark suite provides zero trust, an emerging concept in cybersecurity that is becoming a necessity for enterprises as mobile devices such as wearables become the norm within the workplace. in addition to ivy and spark suite, blackberry has several other more mature product offerings including qnx, blackberry athoc, and blackberry secusuite. while not as exciting as blackberry's recent initiatives, they provide a steady and increasing revenue stream. wall street?s take from wall street analysts, blackberry earns a hold analyst consensus based on 3 hold ratings. additionally, the average price target of $8 puts the downside potential at 18.7%. (see blackberry stock analysis on tipranks) summary and conclusions blackberry has had a turbulent past, downsizing from a $6 billion hardware company into a $1 billion software company over the last seven years. revenue was down 20% year-over-year in the latest quarter, but much of the poor performance can be attributed to the soft auto sector resulting from the pandemic. qnx licensing fees and royalties will pick up as the global economy improves. despite several years of disappointing results, the company has stabilized its financial situation and appears to be positioned to capitalize on several leading-edge technology ventures, including its exclusive partnership with aws and enterprise mobility management and security. given the very low valuation, this could be an ideal time to invest in blackberry. disclaimer: the information contained herein is for informational purposes only. nothing in this article should be taken as a solicitation to purchase or sell securities.

(nasdaq: aapl) has been sued in california over allegations it failed to take action against messaging app telegram in the aftermath of the capitol hill riot even as the platform was used to promote violence.what happened: the coalition for a safer web,  a washington d.c.-based non-profit organization, filed the lawsuit against apple in the united states district court for the northern district of california on sunday.the group alleges that ""telegram is being used to intimidate, threaten, and coerce members of the public,"" and apple -- despite reportedly having this knowledge -- lets telegram be available through the app store on its devices.the lawsuit further alleges that not only was telegram used to promote violence during the storming of capitol hill by outgoing president donald trump's supporters earlier this month, also ""for years, anti-black and anti-semitic groups have openly utilized telegram with little or no content moderation by telegram's management.""""apple has not taken any action against telegram comparable to the action it has taken against parler to compel telegram to improve its content moderation policies."" csw claims.why it matters: telegram ceo pavel durov, in a statement late monday, thanked ""everyone who reported public channels that crossed the line"" in the recent weeks, without mentioning the lawsuit.""telegram welcomes peaceful debate and protest, but our terms of service explicitly prohibit distributing public calls to violence,"" durov said. ""in the last 7 years, we've consistently enforced this rule globally, from belarus and iran to thailand and hong kong.""apple, alongside alphabet inc. (nasdaq: googl) (nasdaq: goog) withdrew social media app parler from their platforms over similar allegations of promoting violence during the capitol hill riot. amazon.com inc. (nasdaq: amzn) too withdrew hosting support, effectively forcing parler to go offline, at least temporarily.telegram, alongside rival privacy-focused messaging app signal, has seen a surge in downloads owing to facebook inc.'s (nasdaq: fb) whatsapp's new proposed privacy policy.price action: apple shares closed 1.37% lower at $127.14 on friday.read next: elon musk sends signal downloads soaring: what you should know about the appsee more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * parler finds its way back online ? thanks to a russian tech firm  * why jack dorsey sees bitcoin as the answer to donald trump ban controversy(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

681,2021-01-19 11:56:05," shares of apple (nasdaq:aapl) moved higher by 11.48% in the past three months. before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt apple has.apple's debt according to the apple's most recent balance sheet as reported on october 30, 2020, total debt is at $112.44 billion, with $98.67 billion in long-term debt and $13.77 billion in current debt. adjusting for $38.02 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $74.42 billion.let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.to understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. considering apple's $323.89 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.35. as a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. a higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. however, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. a debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another.why debt is important debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.however, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios? check out benzinga pro, a market research platform which provides investors with near-instantaneous access to dozens of stock metrics - including debt-to-equity ratio. click here to learn more.  see more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * 10 information technology stocks with unusual options alerts in today's session  * 10 information technology stocks with unusual options alerts in today's session(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

(nasdaq: amd), non-cpu building blocks including accelerators and dpus and alternative arm-based internal chip designs from customers such as apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) and amazon.com, inc.

724,2021-01-20 14:30:21," president-elect joe biden is in the process of piecing together key members of his administration, and three of his potential appointees were making headlines on wall street over the weekend.hard-nosed regulators: first, biden announced monday he will nominate former student loan watchdog rohit chopra as the new head of the consumer financial protection bureau.chopra is currently a member of the federal trade commission, where he worked to publicly push student loan companies to treat their borrowers more fairly during the obama administration. chopra also famously objected to a $5-billion settlement from facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) following a government probe into privacy missteps, claiming the fine imposed was not large enough.related link: here's how americans are spending their stimulus paymentsin addition to chopra's appointment, biden will also be nominating gary gensler to lead the securities and exchange commission. gensler will be replacing jay clayton, who earned a reputation for being soft on wall street during his tenure as sec head.experts say gensler will likely take a much more hands-on approach to banks, brokers and other public companies. gensler enacted a new set of rules for swap trading at the commodity futures trading commission during his tenure as chairman following the chaos that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis.he also oversaw the prosecution of several major investment banks during a libor price-fixing scandal.aggressive stimulus: finally, incoming treasury secretary and former federal reserve chair janet yellen will urge congress to ""act big"" in providing economic stimulus to avoid a prolonged u.s. recession.yellen pledged her support for biden's recently unveiled $1.9-trillion coronavirus relief package as part of her confirmation hearing in front of the senate finance committee on tuesday.""neither the president-elect, nor i, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden. but right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,"" yellen said in a prepared statement.benzinga's take: the general consensus among economists and insiders seems to be that biden's regulatory team is bad news for wall street. trump made a point of appointing regulators that took a hands-off approach to oversight, but biden seems to be going in the opposite direction by selecting regulators with reputations for being aggressive.the nominations of chopra and gensler could be bad news for big tech stocks and banks given the two men's histories of sticking up for consumers and investors.big tech stocks like facebook, amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn), alphabet inc. (nasdaq: goog) (nasdaq: googl), apple, inc. (nasdaq: aapl) and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) could be in for a tough four years ahead.big bank stocks like jpmorgan chase & co. (nyse: jpm), wells fargo & co (nyse: wfc), bank of america corp (nyse: bac) and citigroup inc (nyse: c) could also be on a short leash.at the same time, gensler's appointment could be good news for cryptocurrencies and the grayscale bitcoin trust (otc: gbtc) given he recently taught mit courses on blockchain and digital currencies.the market's positive open on tuesday also suggests investors care more about yellen's bullish stimulus comments than the potential harsh regulatory environment ahead.more stimulus spending in the near-term is good news for bank margins given the yield curve is steepening. inflation concerns could be good news for the spdr gold trust (nyse: gld). infrastructure spending could benefit construction material stocks like commercial metals company (nyse: cmc) and vulcan materials company (nyse: vmc). and finally, biden has made his commitment to clean energy very clear, which could create significant tailwinds for funds like the ishares global clean energy etf (nasdaq: icln).janet yellen, incoming president joe biden's nominee for treasury secretary. benzinga file photo by dustin blitchok. see more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * 7 'blue wave' etfs to buy following democrat senate victories(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

""the problem is, when everyone is in charge, nobody is in charge."" here's what jim cramer says is ahead in 2021 with biden in the white house:e-commerce: the pandemic accelerated the growth of e-commerce, and consumers in 2021 will not slow down on ordering from the comfort of their home, cramer said. companies like amazon (nasdaq: amzn), and walmart (nyse: wmt) have only just begun, he said. travel and leisure: once there is an effective vaccine distribution plan, travel will surge, helping companies like marriott (nasdaq: mar) and airbnb (nasdaq: abnb), cruise lines, airlines and companies like boeing (nyse: ba), the cnbc host said. digitization and cybersecurity: with more technological advancements to come in the cloud realm, cramer said companies like servicenow (nyse: now), microsoft (nasdaq: msft) and salesforce (nyse: crm), and cybersecurity companies such as okta (nasdaq: okta), will all be successful plays in 2021.5g: a massive worldwide shortage exists of semiconductors allowing for massive growth from chip makers such as qualcomm (nasdaq: qcom) and intel corp. (nasdaq: intc) as well as growth from cellphone service providers including t-mobile (nasdaq: tmus).covid-19 stimulus: with another round of stimulus payments expected to soon be in the hands of americans, cramer said retailers like walmart, costco (nasdaq: cost), amazon and target (nyse: tgt) could see upticks in their first-quarter earnings and continued growth through the year.china: in cramer's view, biden is soft on china and companies that are already established in the atmosphere there like apple (nasdaq: aapl), nike (nyse: nke) and starbucks (nasdaq: sbux) will benefit.wealth management: last year represented a surge for wealth and asset management companies such as goldman sachs (nyse: gs), and morgan stanley (nyse: ms), cramer said.morgan stanley was able to capitalize on a new generation of investors who believe that picking your own stocks is a ""good way to manage your money,"" he said. remote work: even with the end of the pandemic on the horizon, remote work is here to stay, cramer said. for the last 10 months, millions of white collar employees have worked from home, and eh said studies show that their productivity rose.companies such as zoom (nasdaq: zm), and amazon will benefit from the creation of more elaborate home offices, he said. health care: biden doesn't have the votes in congress to change much in regards to health care, cramer said, adding that an effort is likely to try to make health insurance cheaper for working class americans, boosting companies like centene (nyse: cnc) and humana (nyse: hum).electric vehicles: with the democratic party being strong on fighting climate change, cramer said people will start to purchase more electric vehicles.companies like tesla (nasdaq: tsla) and the manufacturers merging with special acquisition companies will see unparalleled growth, he said.general motors (nyse: gm) could also see a strong growth year due to its investment in ev manufacturer rivian, cramer said. housing: with biden planning on extending policies allowing more freedom for undocumented immigrants, cramer said millions of people could get credit to buy new homes, adding that homebuilders like pulte group (nyse: phm) will see increases in demand. see more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * qualcomm to buy startup nuvia in .4b deal: what investors need to know  * as trump faces impeachment in final days, cramer sees risk for markets(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

862,2021-01-24 18:27:32," after the fangs, faangs and magas, another acronym taking the investment world by storm is fangman. this acronym is used by traders to refer to stocks of seven of the biggest tech companies in the world.the combined market capitalization of these stocks is about $7.9 trillion, which is roughly 25% of the total market capitalization of s&p 500 companies. to put things in perspective, the combined  market cap  of these seven stocks is more than the gdp of japan, germany or india, which are the third, fourth and fifth largest economies of the world, respectively.the constituentsthe stocks in the fangman group are:  * facebook, inc. common stock (nasdaq: fb)  * amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn)  * netflix inc (nasdaq: nflx)  * alphabet inc class a (nasdaq: googl)  * microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft)  * apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) and  * nvidia corporation (nasdaq: nvda)buoying s&p 500 performance:  2020 was a year marred by the covid-19 pandemic that led to economic contraction worldwide due to disruptions to businesses and other activities. the stock market, given its forward-looking approach, weathered the setback and ended the year with gains.for instance, the  s&p 500 index  ended 2020 at a record high and in the process generated a return of 16.2% for the year. the fangman stocks played a big role int that as they outperformed the broader gauge:  * facebook: 33%  * amazon: 76.3%  * netflix: 67.1%  * alphabet: 30.9%  * microsoft: 42.5%  * apple: 82.3%  * nvidia: 129.3%related link:  10 things apple investors may wish for in 2021 fangman, a predictor of stock market moves?  given the outsized weighting in different indices, it is logical to view fangman stocks as a good predictor of which way the broader market is headed.fangman invariably outperforms market:  for those investors who are looking for above-market returns, or ""high-alpha"" stocks, fangman could be the better bet. these stocks outperform the broader market, thanks to their transformational business models, high growth and financial might, among other things.fangman in bubble territory? from the perspective of topline growth, earnings potential and prospects, it is evident that the lofty valuations are justified. higher p/e multiples of some of these stocks imply investors are willing to pay a premium to partake in their growth.investors see them as compelling, as they are most levered to the digital transformation that is picking up pace.but the stretched valuations of these stocks could conjure up fears of a deep correction.one of the biggest risks faced by these companies is regulatory scrutiny. analysts see the changing of the guard at the white house as a slight negative for these high-flying names.""to be blunt, it's a clear negative for big tech as ultimately with a senate now likely controlled by democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around faang names, with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table,"" wedbush analyst daniel ives said in a jan. 6 note.that said, the analyst remains bullish on tech stocks for 2021, but sees the tech rally will be more tame until the street gets a better sense of the legislative agenda under president joe biden.related link:  why this wedbush analyst expects a year-end tech rally photo by daisy anderson from pexelssee more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * the week ahead in biotech (jan 24-30): j&j, lilly to kickstart big pharma earnings, amgen fda decision and more  * 8 intel analysts on q4 report: why some see difficult years ahead for chipmaker(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

917,2021-01-25 13:29:59," can you say, ""earnings?"" this week is earnings, earnings, and more earnings. wednesday brings the triple crown when tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla), apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), and facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) all report after the close.company reporting hits a crescendo this week and next, accompanied by a mountain of data. the cherry on top is wednesday afternoon when all those big names step to the plate and fed chairman jerome powell takes the mic following the federal open market committee meeting. it's a lot to digest, and investors could have their hands full keeping up. in the background and sometimes the foreground, washington continues to compete for wall street's attention. biden and company are making news every day, often with market implications. last friday's word from capitol hill didn't sound quite as bullish on the stimulus, which weighed on stocks as investors contemplated potentially seeing $1 trillion instead of $2 trillion injected into the economy. but it's still early on that front. it's also early to talk about this week's data calendar, since there's no important data today. as the week advances, however, we'll get plenty. some key reports include consumer confidence, durable goods, and a first look at q4 gross domestic product (gdp). meanwhile, a measure of german business sentiment dropped today, and that appears to be helping the bond market a bit this morning. volatility is also higher, but so are stock index futures. usually, when bonds are up it's a warning sign. so the market is sending mixed pictures early on. apple, tesla, lead the week's earnings parade it's not hard to pick a few earnings that stand out amid all the coming attractions and may set the tone with what they say. aapl and tsla could make for an interesting wednesday afternoon. maybe call them the ""split twins,"" since both were in the headlines last year for splitting shares. everyone knows how tsla stock has gone parabolic since then, but aapl shares actually spent some time wandering in the desert after the split before picking up some momentum and recently powering to new all-time highs. looking ahead to tsla's q4 earnings report and conference call after the close wednesday, investors are likely going to want to hear more details about production, especially after cnbc reported a planned 18-day shutdown of model s and model x lines in california. this might suggest the company isn't seeing as high demand for those older lines as for newer models. with aapl, focus is expected to be on the iphone 12, which the company launched last fall. analysts take different positions on how well aapl did in q4, with some saying it was good but not great and others saying the iphone 12 launch was an amazing success likely to be reflected by earnings. we'll find out wednesday, but investors seem to be thinking positive. shares of aapl are up nearly 3% in pre-market trading today. microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) is another mega-cap reporting this week. focus, as always, could be on its azure cloud product which has been growing like a weed over the last few years but still appears to be trailing amazon.com, inc.'s (nasdaq: amzn) cloud offering. holiday xbox sales also could get a close look from investors. and then there's facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb), which is also scheduled to report wednesday afternoon. analysts are expecting a continuation of the ad revenue growth pattern, but they may be listening extra closely for any comments on the potential regulatory winds that have been swirling in recent days.  last week's tech earnings from ibm common stock (nyse: ibm) and intel corporation (nasdaq: intc) didn't really light the world on fire, so the market might be hoping for something warm and fuzzy out of tech in coming days. maybe johnson & johnson's (nyse: jnj) earnings seemed kind of ho-hum the last few years, but not any more. they'll have a major spotlight tomorrow morning and probably a bigger audience than usual for their conference call, with lots of people hanging on any new word about their phase 3 covid-19 vaccine trial. the company's been talking about having results soon. could tomorrow be the day? we'll wait and find out. positive vaccine news pumped up the market last fall, so don't rule out a possible boost to major indices if jnj's single-injection vaccine results impress. adding everything up, about 20% of s&p 500 companies report this week. some of the other big ones include at&t inc. (nyse: t) and mcdonald corp's (nyse: mcd), verizon communications inc. (nyse: vz), and 3m co (nyse: mmm).  there's so many company reports this week that some who'd normally get a lot of attention, like starbucks corporation (nasdaq: sbux), might get lost in the haze. so far, earnings have been better than expected. going into earnings season, analysts had expected about a 7% year-over-year drop. so far, with 13% of s&p 500 companies reporting, the actual drop has been 4.7%, according to factset. there's still a long way to go, but it looks like the trend seen over the last couple of years where earnings look better in reality than in wall street's initial vision might be continuing.also, 86% of s&p 500 companies have reported a positive eps surprise and 82% have reported a positive revenue surprise, factset said. that's way above historic averages.two-way tech last week saw a split in the tech group, especially friday after old-school tech behemoths ibm common stock (nyse: ibm) and intel corporation (nasdaq: intc) reported. both disappointed wall street, and their weakness spread across not only the sector but possibly to the entire market as stocks struggled to stay above the flat line to end the week.at the same time, more money seemed to flow toward mega-cap tech companies like aapl and msft. rising along with those were adobe inc (nasdaq: adbe) and salesforce.com, inc. (nyse: crm), whose cloud divisions look strong compared to what people heard from ibm on friday. it's tough straits for ibm here. they made a big investment in cloud technology and it's not necessarily paying off the way some investors might have hoped. meanwhile, chip makers forged new highs throughout last week and aapl and msft continued to grind upward ahead of their respective earnings. these fresh all-time peaks can be a double-edged sword for investors as earnings approach. one thing to remember is that when a company reports earnings and its stock is at or near historic peaks, the pressure can really be on to meet or exceed expectations. a stock that's priced for perfection tends to do badly when perfection isn't achieved in an earnings report. that's a warning not just for shareholders of aapl, which is scheduled to report wednesday, but for a host of other companies reporting this week with their shares on a roll including d.r. horton inc (nyse: dhi), starbucks corporation (nasdaq: sbux), illumina, inc. (nasdaq: ilmn), stryker corporation (nyse: syk), and, of course, tsla. boeing co (nyse: ba) is also on the docket this week, its first earnings report since getting the 737 max back in the air. shares of ba and the airlines continue to get dragged as u.s. passenger traffic slumped after a brief uptick around the holidays.the fed meeting that starts tomorrow almost gets pushed to the background with all this earnings news swirling around. it's hard to imagine them saying much of anything different, though obviously we'll look for any observations on inflation.chart of the day: paying a premium. nothing's rallying quite like the small-cap russell 2000 index (rut--candlestick). it's now trading at around 1.37 times its 200-day moving average (blue line). rut's current premium to its 200-day ma exceeds even the one recorded in early 2000, which was close to 1.3 but never this high. data source: ftse russell.  chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results.  gdp stands out in critical data week: you can almost pick and choose your favorite data  to watch each day, there's so much on th

919,2021-01-25 13:47:21," looks like another busy week for investors and traders with the focus on earnings, the fomc meeting, u.s. economic data, and u.s. indices holding at or near new all-time highs. first and foremost, with u.s. indices to new all-time highs last week, companies reporting quarterly results this week should be closely watched. we have 120 s&p 500 companies reporting and a few tech names that could move markets; keep an eye on tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla), apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft), and boeing co (nyse: ba), to name a few. last week, the move up was largely led by the nasdaq and tech strength after nflx beat expectations; this week we're seeing somewhat of a mixed start, but it will be interesting to see if tech continues to shine bright.we also have some closely-watched economic data this week like durable goods, gdp, more housing data, weekly jobless claims, and the personal income and spending data due out friday will help provide further insight as to what's happening on the inflation front. don't forget about the fed meeting this week. investors and traders will be paying close attention to the two-day meeting, which begins tuesday. wednesday afternoon we'll get their decision on rates and bond purchases, and the q&a session with fed chair jerome powell will follow.oftentimes the fed meeting provides for some good market volatility. keep an eye on the u.s. dollar and u.s. treasuries to see how they respond to the news (or lack of); the fed is expected to leave rates unchanged and purchases as is. in terms of individual markets to watch, i think crude and copper will be key in the coming weeks to determine how the demand narrative is playing out. last week the eia reported the first build in inventories for the new year; if that becomes a trend, it would not be a good sign. as always, lots to stay on top of, and lots to keep an eye on this week that could move markets!photo by markus spiske on unsplashsee more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * friday's market minute: is bitcoin at an inflection point?  * thursday's market minute: tech stocks take off(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

928,2021-01-25 15:28:35," the coronavirus outbreak severely disrupted the stock market and the economy in 2020. while most stocks took a pounding during the covid-19 sell-off early in the year, many soared to new all-time highs during the market recovery later in 2020. in 2020, u.s. short sellers logged $345 billion in net in mark-to-market losses, according to s3 partners analyst ihor dusaniwsky. a large portion of those losses came from a handful of heavily shorted stocks that crushed short sellers last year.""the largest losses were in the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors while there were minimal profits in the energy, real estate, financial and utilities sectors,"" dusaniwsky said thursday.related link: 10 stocks that earned short sellers the most profits in 2020tesla the biggest short killer: dusaniwsky said electric vehicle manufacturer tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) was by far the worst short in the market in 2020.tesla short sellers lost more than $40.1 billion 2020, nearly six times the losses they endured betting against any other stock in the market.apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) was a distant second, with short sellers taking just a $6.7-billion mark-to-market loss on the year.dusaniwsky said tesla averaged about $17.8 billion in total short interest in 2020. not only was tesla a bad stock to bet against in 2020, it was the single best-performing s&p 500 stock of the year, gaining roughly 700%.worst shorts of 2020 here's a look at the 10 worst stocks to short in the market in 2020, sorted by net mark-to-market losses:  * tesla, -$40.1 billion.  * apple, -$6.7 billion.  * amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn), -$5.7 billion.  * pinduoduo inc - adr (nasdaq: pdd), -$4.8 billion.  * square inc (nyse: sq), -$4.7 billion.  * sea ltd (nyse: se), -$4.2 billion.  * nio inc - adr (nyse: nio), -$3.6 billion.  * microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft), -$3.2 billion.  * carvana co (nyse: cvna), -$3.1 billion.  * twilio inc (nyse: twlo), -$2.9 billion.benzinga's take: the least profitable shorts are not necessarily the stocks that gained the most in 2020, but rather stocks that have big gains and also the largest amounts of short interest.these 10 stocks highlight the extreme risk involved in short selling, which has theoretical gains capped at 100% while theoretical losses are unlimited.photo courtesy of square. latest ratings for tsla  datefirmactionfromto  jan 2021bairdmaintainsoutperform  jan 2021jp morganmaintainsunderweight  jan 2021oppenheimermaintainsoutperform    view more analyst ratings for tsla   view the latest analyst ratingssee more from benzinga  * click here for options trades from benzinga  * gamestop's power surge: will wallstreetbets or the short sellers come out on top?  * jpmorgan upgrades ford: 'incoming tide of hot new products'(c) 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

996,2021-01-26 10:44:46," in a surprise twist, the nasdaq surged by a healthy 4.2% last week, managing to close the week at an all-time high. what?s happening to tech stocks? surging, gaining...come again? wasn't tech supposed to wither away and die thanks to be big bad democrat boogeymen? wasn?t the radical biden tax agenda and regulatory framework supposed to send your favorite tech stocks plummeting? wasn?t biden?s tax plan supposed to take an estimated 5-10% off the earnings per share? for now, it seems like the market is putting more of its hopes into biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan and ignoring his tax and regulation plans. as treasury secretary and former fed chair janet yellen claimed, biden's primary focus is aiding american families (i.e., stimulus, low-interest rates) and, for now, not raising taxes. but nothing is for sure with this stimulus. republicans will resist it, and some moderate democrats may do so as well. with vice president kamala harris as the only tiebreaker for a democrat majority in the senate, biden needs all the support he can get to pass this aggressive stimulus. i maintain my view that the market is too complacent, and that we are about to enter a correction at some point in the short-term. it still reminds me of the q4 2018 pullback. for one, valuations are absurd. tech ipos are a circus, the s&p 500 is at or near its most-expensive level in recent history on most measures, and the russell 2000 has never traded this high above its 200-day moving average. while stimulus could be useful for stocks in the short-term, it could almost certainly mean the return of inflation too by mid-year. the worst part about it? the fed will likely let it run hot. with debt rising and consumer spending expected to increase as vaccines are rolled out to the masses, the fed is undoubtedly more likely to let inflation rise than letting interest rates rise. others, however, believe that the market reflects optimism that the global economy will recover with the eventual lifting of covid-related restrictions and more widely-available vaccines. john studzinski , vice chairman of pimco, believes that market valuations are strong and reflect expectations of this eventual reopening and economic recovery by the second half of the year. all of this simply tells me that the market remains a pay-per-view fight between good news and bad news. we may trade sideways this quarter- that would not shock me in the least. but i think we are long overdue for a correction since we haven?t seen one since last march. corrections are healthy for markets and more common than most realize. only twice in the last 38 years have we had years without a correction (1995 and 2017). a correction could also be an excellent buying opportunity for what should be a great second half of the year. therefore, to sum it up: while there is long-term optimism, there are short-term concerns. a short-term correction between now and q1 2021 is possible. i don't think that a decline above ~20%, leading to a bear market will happen. in a report released last tuesday, jan. 19, goldman sachs shared the same sentiments. my goal for these updates is to educate you, give you ideas, and help you manage money like i did when i was pressing the buy and sell buttons for $600+ million in assets. i left that career to pursue one where i could help people who needed help, instead of the ultra-high net worth. hopefully, you find my insights enlightening, and i welcome your thoughts and questions. we have a critical week ahead with the fed set to have its first monetary policy meeting of the year and big earnings announcements on the horizon. best of luck, have an excellent trading week, and have fun! we'll check back in with you all mid-week. are we in a tech bubble or not? figure 1- nasdaq composite index $comp some of the hottest performing tech stocks announce earnings this week such as apple (aapl), amazon (amzn), microsoft (msft), tesla (tsla) (yes i consider tesla more of a tech stock than a car stock), and more. pay very close attention. although i am bullish on specific tech sectors such as cloud computing, e-commerce, and fintech for 2021, i?m concerned about the mania consuming tech stocks. tech valuations, and especially the tech ipo market, terrify me. it reminds me a lot of the dot-com bubble 20-years ago. remember, the dot-com bubble was a major crash in the nasdaq after excessive speculation and ipos sent any internet-related stock soaring. between 1995-2000 the nasdaq surged 400%. by october 2002, the nasdaq declined by a whopping 78%. i have no other words to describe it besides the nasdaq right now as a circus. will the bubble pop now? that remains to be seen. but the similarities between now and 2000 are striking. i am sticking with the theme of using the rsi to judge how to call the nasdaq. an overbought rsi does not automatically mean a trend reversal, but with the nasdaq, this appears to have been a consistent pattern over the last few weeks. the nasdaq pulled back on december 9 after exceeding an rsi of 70 and briefly pulled back again after passing 70 again around christmas time. we also exceeded a 70 rsi just before the new year, and what happened on the first trading day of 2021? a decline of 1.47%. the last time i changed my nasdaq call from a hold to a sell on january 11 after the rsi exceeded 70, the nasdaq declined again by 1.45%. the nasdaq has an rsi of around 72 again, and i?m switching the call back to sell. the nasdaq is trading in a precise pattern and i am basing my calls on that pattern. i still love tech and am bullish for 2021. but i need to see the nasdaq have a legitimate cooldown period and move closer to its 50-day moving average before considering it a buy. for an etf that attempts to directly correlate with the performance of the nasdaq, the invesco qqq etf (qqq) is a good option. matthew levy, cfa stock trading strategist sunshine profits: effective investment through diligence & care benzinga's related links: 61 stocks moving in monday's mid-day session what the options market is saying about the big tech earnings reports this week * * * * * all essays, research, and information found above represent analyses and opinions of matthew levy, cfa and sunshine profits' associates only. as such, it may prove wrong and be subject to change without notice. opinions and analyses were based on data available to authors of respective essays at the time of writing. although the information provided above is based on careful research and sources that are believed to be accurate, matthew levy, cfa, and his associates do not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the data or information reported. the opinions published above are neither an offer nor a recommendation to purchase or sell any securities. mr. levy is not a registered securities advisor. by reading matthew levy, cfa?s reports you fully agree that he will not be held responsible or liable for any decisions you make regarding any information provided in these reports. investing, trading, and speculation in any financial markets may involve high risk of loss. matthew levy, cfa, sunshine profits' employees, and affiliates as well as members of their families may have a short or long position in any securities, including those mentioned in any of the reports or essays, and may make additional purchases and/or sales of those securities without notice. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingahow to trade palantir demo day using options spreads38 stocks moving in tuesday's pre-market session?

1000,2021-01-26 12:07:57," it's the largest sector in the s&p 500 and perhaps the most beloved, so it's not surprising that technology draws a crows. what happened it's also not surprising that some traders love leverage with technology exchange traded funds and in an expanding universe of such tactical instruments, an old friend should be on traders' radar screens this year: the direxion daily technology bull 3x shares (nyse: tecl). up nearly 16% over the past week, tecl attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the s&p 500 technology index. that makes tecl a leveraged proxy on apple (nasdaq: aapl) and microsoft (nasdaq: msft) as those two tech titans combine for over 43% of that index. why it's important as a triple-leveraged play on a sector that isn't exactly docile, tecl shouldn't be held for more than a few days at a time. however, the environment is right for traders to move in and out of tecl over the course of 2021. ?if part of the thesis for further stock gains is massive central bank liquidity, tech should benefit from this trend, particularly if volatility continues to fall. since 2008 tech has generally outperformed when financial conditions are improving. the average outperformance is approximately 30-35 basis points (bps) a month,? according to blackrock. another reason traders may want to embrace tecl this year is that the coronavirus pandemic, for its obvious negative consequences, is having some positive effects on tech. ?a good example of this is online shopping. looking at domestic credit card data reveals an interesting pattern. as you would have expected, the share of spending going to online retailers spiked early in the pandemic, notes blackrock. ?less obvious was the staying power of this trend. even as lockdowns eased, online retailer?s wallet share remained elevated relative to the pre-pandemic norm. in other words, even as consumer mobility returned, many households came to appreciate the convenience of services such as online grocery delivery.? what's next another catalyst for tecl is the robust consumer side of the tech story ? one that's a potential spark for many of the stocks in tecl's index, such as apple. ?household tech spending increased by more than $100 billion, or 25%, in the six months between may and november. while some of the end-of-year bump was a function of early holiday spending, the trend is clear and has been in place for some time,? notes blackrock. ?for investors, all of this suggests pivoting within tech rather than abandoning the sector.? see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingadouble the excitement: proshares new geared cloud computing, cybersecurity etfsstudy indicates work from home etf could have ample staying power? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1003,2021-01-26 12:56:37," trying to keep up with all the earnings news? it?s a challenge, but a welcome one for many investors anxious to see how q4 turned out for the major companies. the day begins with a fresh batch of earnings data but nothing new on the vaccine front. johnson & johnson (nyse: jnj) had really nice earnings and so did raytheon technologies corp (nyse: rtx). meanwhile, microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft), texas instruments incorporated (nasdaq: txn) and starbucks corporation (nasdaq: sbux) wait in the wings for after the close. there?s so much to look at today it?s hard to keep track of everything. some investors might have been hoping for a vaccine update from jnj as part of its earnings today. instead, the company promised results, ?soon.? with a lot of people worried about new virus variants and slower than expected ramp-up of vaccinations, any positive news on jnj?s vaccine would probably be welcomed. looks like we?ll have to wait a bit longer. we won?t have to wait much longer for the latest fed observations. they start their meeting today and chairman jerome powell takes the podium tomorrow afternoon. there?s not much drama here. it would be shocking if the fed said anything other than what it?s been saying about keeping things dovish so the economy can recover. it is the fed, so you have to pay attention, and of course consider listening for anything they say about possible inflation. otherwise, it?s probably going to be like sitting through the same movie you just watched. yesterday, ?risk-off? trading dominated. bonds and volatility rose amid virus worries. today, bonds stepped back just a bit, crude is holding steady, and markets in europe rose overnight amid strong earnings over there. that, combined with the morning?s solid set of u.s. earnings reports, might explain the light pre-market gains for some of the major indices. toilet paper and canned stew on the first day of the biggest earnings week of the year, what rallied? companies that make toilet paper, household cleaners, and canned beef stew. kimberly clark corp (nyse: kmb), clorox co (nyse: clx), and hormel foods corp (nyse: hrl) partied like it was 2020 on monday. at the same time, big-tech got some bids ahead of microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) reporting later today and apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla), and facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) going tomorrow. basically, the market behaved like everyone would be staying home a while longer, with investors once again embracing the stocks that rocked when lockdowns first hit. meanwhile, the airlines that had found some buyers last week got sent back to the hangar, with american airlines group inc (nasdaq: aal), delta air lines, inc. (nyse: dal), and united airlines holdings inc (nasdaq: ual) suffering sharp losses. at the same time, bonds also received some new love, pushing the 10-year treasury yield down to 1.03% by the end of the day after it touched 1.19% earlier this month. right now, yields might remind you of a turtle that stuck its head out from under its shell, sniffed the air, and then decided it was safer inside. the yield is at its lowest level since jan. 6. all this could mean there?s trepidation about the pandemic, especially with europe facing more trouble and new strains in the u.k. and south africa. carnival corp (nye:ccl) pushed back cruises. also, the biden administration?s decision yesterday to suspend travel to the u.s. from some countries helped reinforce that we?re far from being out of the woods. the cboe volatility index (vix) climbed above 24 for a while yesterday after dropping below 22 at times last week, a possible sign of investors fearing more choppiness in the coming days. the ?risk-off? mood might have gained strength by having 20% of the s&p 500 reporting this week and slow progress on vaccinations here. the market?s had an incredible run and many analysts worry things have gotten a little bit priced for perfection. there?s also concern that the biden administration?s stimulus package might be pushed back on the calendar or trimmed, as it continues to face resistance in congress. this could have been a factor pressing on some of the cyclical sectors yesterday like financials and energy, research firm briefing.com noted. what goes up... gamestop?s wild session also, when you observe action like we saw in gamestop corp. (nyse: gme) yesterday, you start to scratch your head a little. the stock more than doubled at one point and trading had to be halted several times for volatility. like it or not, this is the type of stuff that makes veteran investors think back to the crazy days of 1999 and 2000. gme is up another 14% in pre-market trading. it?s not too hard to find analysts who believe gme is trading far beyond its fundamentals, and there was talk that monday?s move might have reflected a ?short squeeze.? sometimes a short squeeze is followed by more buying, which was apparently the case last year with tsla. it can also indicate lots of people with deep pockets not necessarily investing in a stock, but trading it. there?s nothing wrong with that, but if you?re a long-term investor it?s probably not a great idea to get too deeply involved in these moves. this is not normal activity, and you also have to be careful that when the music stops, so to speak?or when these buyers stop and it becomes like a game of musical chairs?that you?re not the one stuck without a chair and nowhere to turn to sell. the momentum that caused gme to go up can also be the momentum that causes it to go down, very quickly. caution is the watchword, for gme and many other stocks that have been making new highs. earnings could be the time when companies need to offer proof that their high prices are justified by the fundamentals. looking ahead to this afternoon?s fundamentals, msft earnings could go a long way toward starting to tell the broader tech story. analysts expect the company?s commercial cloud segment to again be the main driver, with focus as always on azure, msft?s main cloud platform. azure sales grew 48% in the prior quarter, outrunning wall street?s estimates. we?ll see what sort of encore msft reports today. starbucks corporation (nasdaq: sbux) is a big company reporting after the close that almost gets lost in the shuffle with so many behemoths on the calendar this week. investors can listen to the sbux call to get a sense of how the company?s been dealing with various state lockdowns and reopenings. they might also get word on whether its huge international business, especially in china, has started to reflect the bigger economic growth seen there recently. tomorrow morning get ready for some more big names, including abbott laboratories (nyse: abt) and boeing co (nyse: ba). boeing?s earnings will be the first for the company since the 737 max began flying again. tomorrow afternoon is the big showdown as tsla, aapl, and fb all come to the table after the close. also, tomorrow brings the close of the federal open market committee (fomc) meeting and the latest economic observations from fed chairman jerome powell. if you?re bored wednesday afternoon, you can?t blame it on the market. one thing monday?s quick early reversal from the opening rally might remind people of is how important it is to look at the warning signs when they flash. bonds and volatility were both higher along with stocks at the start of yesterday?s session. when you see that combination, it often means stocks are on a leash. consider keeping an eye on 25 for the vix and 1% for the 10-year treasury yield. penetration above that on vix or below that on yield could be another warning sign to bullish stock market investors. chart of the day: bonds spoil banks? party. the bond market has been climbing recently, taking the 10-year treasury yield (tnx?candlestick) down to nearly three-week lows. falling yields can take the starch out of the financial sector (ixm?purple line), and that?s what apparently happened over the last few days. data sources: s&p dow jones indices, cme group. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform

1010,2021-01-26 14:19:51," did someone say $100 billion? and then some? wall street analysts did. a consensus sees apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) as joining that rarefied corporate crowd that?s broken the $100 billion in quarterly revenues mark when it opens the books wednesday on its fiscal q1. that?s a record for aapl, of course, and may have been assisted by holiday sales of its new iphone 12. but it?s one in a series of fresh peaks aapl has scored in a year?one the company acknowledged was rocked by adversity in many corners. chief financial officer luca maestri said the strong results in last quarter?s report were driven by ?the unmatched loyalty of our customers.? that may or not be true, but when aapl reports earnings, investors also will be listening to how well aapl is playing the market share game. the work-from-home trend, fueled by the pandemic, looks like it might have been a game-changer for aapl, according to morningstar analysts who believe it powered sales of ipads, desktops, and laptops. all that could be overshadowed in fiscal q1 by iphone 12 holiday sales, which it?s probably safe to say will get a fair share of attention wednesday afternoon following the closing bell. aapl has always been an attention-getter when earnings season rolls around, and now, with it sporting a $2.34 trillion market cap and reaching new stock price highs, it looks like it?s sure to take a spot under the limelight even when it?s up against a host of other high-profile tech stocks earnings results this week. tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) and facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) report the same afternoon. the numbers wall street analysts expect aapl revenue to jump 12% year-over-year to about $103 billion, according to factset. but some firms, such as loup ventures, are looking for much stronger numbers: up 19% to $109.5 billion. from an earnings perspective, the street has reached a consensus of $1.41 a share. morgan stanley (nyse: ms) is also forecasting on the high side of consensus, eyeing revenues of $108.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.50. ?our recent conversations suggest investors expect apple to release solid, but not great, december quarter results,? morgan stanley analysts wrote in a recent report. ?we disagree and believe that apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings. ?in our view, the iphone 12 has been apple?s most successful product launch in the last five years,? they said. more on that later. any way you look at it, the numbers look robust. the innovation machine aapl stopped giving guidance last year?kind of like many other companies uncertain of the ramifications of covid-19 on their sales. in march, no one knew what the ricochet effects of the pandemic might be or how long it might last. we still don?t know all of that, but we have found that the city- and state-mandated quarantines and the overall fear of being in public helped fast-forward many trends that were already picking up steam. the digital transformation sped up, and it looks like aapl might have been well-positioned for it. while the iphone 12 might get most of the attention wednesday, think back to last quarter when ceo tim cook noted all-time records for mac and services. though he didn?t offer guidance for this past quarter per se, he did suggest double-digit gains on all product categories except the iphone 12, which he thought would reach single-digit gains. figure 1: apple leaves index in the dust. over the last year, shares of apple (aapl?candlestick) have easily outpaced the nasdaq-100 index (ndx?purple line). apple shares got off to a quick start in 2021, with investors apparently enthusiastic about tomorrow?s q1 earnings prospects. data source: nasdaq. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. the mighty iphone 5g launch despite all the happy talk about fiscal q4 revenues, iphone?s weaker-than-expected sales offset the glee and pulled shares down nearly 6% in the first couple of days after the october earnings release. they have since recovered. aapl reported iphone sales of $26.4 billion in fiscal q4, below the $27.73 billion expected by the street. much of that shortfall was attributed to aapl?s decision to push the iphone 12 launch into this most recent quarter, a move many believe may have led to consumers waiting for the upgrade before they bought. back then, some analysts said a move to 5g could end up being a tailwind for the iphone 12 with sales promotions and subscription services bundles. that, combined with the important holiday shopping season about to begin, could have led to a fast start for the new phone. we?ll see now if they were right. analysts are mostly bullish on their iphone sales expectations, with some saying the delay might have pushed around $4 billion in iphone sales to the december quarter from the fiscal q3. the street?s consensus last stood at $59.58 billion, up better than 6% on a year-over-year basis. but loup ventures thinks that?s conservative. it?s looking for sales to vault 16% on a year-over-year basis to $64.9 billion, jumping to 59% of total sales compared with the iphone?s typical 50% of sales standing. it?s unclear if that will actually be the case, but if it is it would reverse a trend in recent years toward iphones being less of aapl?s total revenue. the company has been emphasizing growth in services. remember, we?re just two years out from january 2019 when cook sent a letter to aapl investors warning of a fiscal q1 earnings shortfall due in part to weak iphone sales in china. how things have changed. aapl earnings and options activity aapl is expected to report an adjusted eps of $1.41, up from $1.25 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. revenue is projected at $103.01 billion, up 16.4% from a year ago. the options market has priced in an expected share price move of 6.2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the market maker move? indicator on the thinkorswim? platform. looking at the jan. 29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 125 and 135 strikes. but it?s been dwarfed by activity to the upside, heavy call volume at the 145 and 150 strikes. the implied volatility sits at the 34th percentile as of tuesday morning. note: call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. home work and its tools the work- and study-from-home phenomenon helped drive sales of macs and ipads last year, and analysts widely expect that trend continued into the fiscal q1. a number of bells and whistles were added to new ipads and ipad airs, and new computers with aapl?s custom m1 chip replacing the intel corporation (nasdaq: intc) chip also hit the market. aapl also is reportedly working on a new ipad pro expected to be released in mid-march. there?s also talk on wall street that aapl might have patented a new version of the magic keyboard for the ipad pro. given cook?s comments about the ?most prolific product introduction period,? analysts widely expect to hear about other new products coming on line. an update of the macbook air is one of those possible developments. aapl is working on a thinner and lighter version of the macbook air, bloomberg reported late last week, citing ?people with knowledge of the matter. analysts said they want to know if the planned release in the second half of this year is on track. analysts at monness, crespi, hardt & co. expect aapl to shed light on several new products and services, including how sales are going for its $549 airpods max over-the-ear headphones and the subscription apple fitness+ offering, plus ways to bundle services together for a discount. ?in our view, apple?s portfolio was positioned better-than-ever heading into the recent holiday season, while product and service updat

1017,2021-01-26 16:43:38," (bloomberg) -- microsoft corp. said fiscal second-quarter sales rose 17%, a faster clip than analysts projected, thanks to buoyant demand for corporate cloud-computing services and software tools that support at-home workers. shares soared in late trading.revenue in the period ended dec. 31 rose to $43.1 billion, the redmond, washington-based software maker said tuesday in a statement. that exceeded the $40.2 billion average estimate of analysts polled by bloomberg, and marked microsoft?s 14th straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. net income was $15.5 billion, or $2.03 a share. analysts had predicted $1.64.growth in the company?s azure cloud-computing division jumped 50%. microsoft has benefited as many corporate clients have accelerated a shift to the cloud, where they can store data and run applications via the internet, and as businesses set up work teams with online productivity tools and teleconferencing software. personal-computer sales also surged in the quarter, boosting the company?s flagship windows operating-system business.?cloud is going well, said mark moerdler, an analyst at sanford c. bernstein & co. ?margins have moved up nicely. there really isn?t a lot that hasn?t gone well.?microsoft shares climbed about 5% in extended trading following the report. the stock rose 5.7% during the quarter, compared with a 12% gain in the s&p 500 index. stock increases earlier in the year left the company with an expanded price-to-future-earnings multiple that is larger than peers like facebook and google, said bloomberg intelligence?s anurag rana.sales in each of microsoft?s three divisions exceeded the average estimates of analysts polled by bloomberg. corporate versions of office 365 cloud-based software saw revenue rise 21% in the quarter, the company said.the pandemic caused some companies to speed up moves to the cloud and upgrades to internet-based collaboration software. even though the market is growing, microsoft continues to face competition from amazon.com inc.?s aws and a renewed cloud-infrastructure push at alphabet inc.?s google. azure?s revenue gain in the recent quarter exceeded the 43% growth rate predicted by analysts, and outpaced the prior period?s increase of 48%.global pc shipments jumped 26% in the quarter, according to research firm idc, with demand fueled by the continued need to work and learn from home. some of that strength may carry into 2021. intel corp., the world?s largest chipmaker, reported results that exceeded analysts? expectations last week and offered a bright forecast for laptop sales for the first half of the year. after that, a lot depends on whether corporate spending picks up, intel said.the earnings report also provided a look at initial sales of microsoft?s new generation of xbox game consoles, called the series x and series s, which hit stores in november and have been sold out ever since. xbox content and services revenue jumped 40% in the december quarter, microsoft said.as more supply of xbox consoles becomes available, it will be clearer how the new machines are faring versus a rival pair of new playstations, which have also been in very short supply after a november launch.(updates with details from report starting in fifth paragraph.)for more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 bloomberg l.p.

1018,2021-01-26 16:45:17," benzinga's premarket prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. et. during that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. on any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts joel elconin and dennis dick along with producer spencer israel. even if one had a company?s earnings report ahead of the release, it still may be hard to predict the price action of the issue in the upcoming session. with that being said, general electric (nyse: ge) is the premarket prep stock of the day. underperformer in 2020: after ending 2019 at $11.26, ge followed the s&p 500 index higher, reaching $13.26 in february before retreating to end the month at $10.88. it cratered with the broad market in march, falling to $5.90, and attempted to rebound. whereas the index bottomed in march, ge undercut its mach low by declining to $5.49 in may. that low coincided almost to the penny with its march 2009 low of $5.51. the index sharply rebounded from its march low to end the year with a 15% gain, while ge ended the year slightly in the red ($11.18 versus $10.80). it should be noted that a vast majority of the gains off the low came in november ($7.42 to $10.18). off to a good start in 2021: the issue has moved in sync with the index in 2021. both bottomed on the first trading day of the year, which for ge was $10.40, and began to rally. at the time of the writing of this article, the s&p 500 index is higher by 2.7%, with ge being higher by nearly 5.5% ($10.80 vs, $11.40). wall street cautious ahead of earnings: ge ended monday?s session ($10.99) well off its yearly high from jan. 12 ($11.91), which was the same day of its closing high price for the year ($11.78). in fact, in monday?s sell-off it matched its year-end price ($10.80) when bottomed at $10.77. view more earnings on ge mixed q4 report: before the open, the company announced a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report. while beating on the top line for sales ($21.93 billion versus the $21.83 billion estimate), the company missed on the bottom line by a penny. the bright spot in the report was power orders of $5.6 billion, which was up 26%. premarket prep take on premarket price action: off the print, investors choose to emphasize the sales beat. the issue immediately began to rally in almost a straight-up manner. ahead of the opening bell, the issue peaked at $12.15 and managed to open just above the yearly high ($11.91) and $12 psychological resistance level. when the issue was being discussed it was trading actively at the $12 area. investors were cautioned that if the issue opened above $12 and was unable to sustain that level, the issue may surrender some of its gains. the full discussion on the issue from today?s show can be found here: price action during the regular session: ge buyers were able to satisfy all the sellers in the lower $12 area and the stock was able to breach the premarket high ($12.15), reaching $12.23, and then sharply reversed course. it continued to make new lows for the session, with the current being $11.25 as of 1 p.m. et. photo credit: momoneymoproblemz, via wikimedia commons see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingapremarket prep stock of the day: general motorspremarket prep stock of the day: jumia? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1022,2021-01-26 17:02:40," plant-based food maker beyond meat inc (nasdaq: bynd) deserves credit for striking a partnership with pepsico, inc. (nasdaq: pep) but the stock's reaction ""overshoots the actual financial opportunity,"" according to jpmorgan. whenever a small company like beyond meat strikes any sort of partnership with a global giant like pepsico, it's ""usually good news,"" analyst ken goldman wrote in a note. but in reality, the financial upside for beyond meat is smaller than investors assume. the collaboration between the two could consist of beyond meat supplying pepsico with plant-based alternatives to cheese for its tostitos salsa or creating a new lineup of fully vegan doritos. related link: beyond meat soars after announcing joint venture with pepsi while beyond meat should be able to supply pepsico with what it needs to create vegan products, the market opportunity for vegan doritos is likely not large enough to justify the stock's surge above $200 per share. ""so we would fade this news,"" the analyst wrote. ""maybe today (or even tomorrow) isn't the best time to do it, not with the market still forcing shorts to cover left and right."" goldman maintains an underweight rating on beyond meat's stock similarly, wells fargo analysts said that beyond meat's upside from working with pepsico is minimal. the two companies can find success in working together to lower sodium content but there is ""no commercially viable"" product the two can launch together. cramer chats with ceo: beyond meat ceo ethan brown told jim cramer why the partnership with pepsico is the most important deal in the company's history. the simple reason is that ""pepsico is everywhere,"" cramer said on cnbc. but cramer questions if beyond meat's stock should have been up by more than 30% tuesday morning. the stock has attracted short interest as some investors believe beyond meat has been losing ground in the growing competitive environment.' nevertheless, short investors were not anticipating tuesday's announcement that was the culmination of years in the making, cramer said. bynd price action: share of beyond meat hit a new all-time high of $221 tuesday morning and were trading higher by 20% to $190 at publication time. latest ratings for bynd datefirmactionfromto jan 2021longbow researchinitiates coverage onneutral jan 2021btigdowngradesbuyneutral jan 2021piper sandlerdowngradesoverweightneutral view more analyst ratings for bynd view the latest analyst ratings see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingabeyond meat soars after announcing joint venture with pepsibeyond meat analyst: attractive growth story takes back seat to valuation concerns? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1026,2021-01-26 17:42:39," the ability of members of u.s. congress to buy and sell stocks has been controversial over the years. one of its most prominent members made some purchases in december that could benefit from the new biden administration. what happened: it was revealed over the weekend that speaker of the house and california rep. nancy pelosi purchased 25 call options of tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla). the purchases could have been done by pelosi or her husband paul, who runs a venture capital firm. the options were bought at a stake price of $500 and expiration of march 18, 2022. pelosi paid between $500,000 and $1,000,000 for the options, according to the disclosure. pelosi also disclosed that she bought 20,000 shares of alliancebernstein holdings (nyse: ab), 100 calls of apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) and 100 calls of walt disney co (nyse: dis). tesla shares have risen from $640.34 at the time the calls were purchased to over $890 today. the call options were valued at $1.12 million as of monday. related link: how the 2020 presidential election could impact ev, auto stocks why it?s important: the purchases by pelosi are questionable as arguments could be made that the companies stand to benefit from new president joe biden?s agenda. biden's push for electric vehicles, which could include lifting the cap on sales, would give buyers tax credits again and is advantageous for tesla. the president has also suggested a possible cash-for-clunkers program that could incentivize customers for trading in used vehicles towards the purchase of an electric vehicle. pelosi could now have a conflict as she works to pass clean energy initiatives from which her family could profit. former u.s. senator david perdue, a republican, was criticized for making numerous stock trades during his six years in congress. perdue was the most prominent stock trader from congress, making 2,596 trades during his time served. some of perdue?s transactions came while he was a member of several sub-committees. the justice department investigated perdue and found no wrongdoing. what?s next: it's legal for members of congress and their spouses to own stocks. the transactions have to be disclosed per the stock (stop trading on congressional knowledge) act that was passed in 2012. u.s. senator jeff merkley of oregon is one member of congress who has co-sponsored legislation to ban the adding of individual stocks by members of congress. both merkley and pelosi are democrats. pelosi?s transactions could push for more regulations concerning stock purchases by members of congress.

1030,2021-01-26 19:55:56," facebook inc (nasdaq: fb) and apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) both report earnings wednesday after the close. here's a look at the recent stocks' history and how options are pricing the expected move out to this friday. apple options are pricing about a 6% move in either direction by jan. 29 expiration, which captures earnings: prior apple earnings weeks via options ai calendar facebook options are also pricing about a 6% move in either direction by jan. 29 expiration, which captures earnings. for this week, that corresponds to about $265 and $300 in the stock. and the prior facebook earnings weeks via options ai calendar using option spreads and the expected move the options ai expected move chart helps traders visualize just how much volatility option traders are pricing into stocks like apple and facebook and in what timeframe. and when the expected move is large, it follows that buying options can be expensive. so, using facebook as an example, we look at how spreads can be used to either lower that cost through buying debit spreads or generate income through selling credit spreads and how the expected move can be used to help guide strike selection. using the move for bullish spread strategies let's consider the scenario where as a trader you are bullish and knowing the expected move to your timeframe, you also believe that the options market is generally correct in its bullish consensus. in other words, the stock is going up, but its likely not going beyond where the market has priced a potential move. in this scenario, rather than simply buying a call option, you might choose to simultaneously sell a higher strike call at the expected move level, creating a debit call spread. this lowers the overall cost (thereby also lowering the breakeven level and increasing probability of profit) in exchange for capping potential upside (beyond where the market has priced the move). let's look at an example as applied to facebook. below is a $15 debit call spread for february 19th, capturing both demo day, and earnings, with a breakeven in the stock near $36, and max profit above $42: view more earnings on fb now let's look at an alternative bullish strategy that seeks not to lower cost, but rather to capitalize on higher option prices and generate income by ?selling to the bears'. below, we see a $15 wide credit put spread, that could be viewed as essentially ?mirroring' the debit call spread ? in this case selling an at-the-money put option and simultaneously buying a put option at the expected move level (thereby limiting potential downside and defining risk). note that maximum gain is realized with a move higher in the stock ? essentially being bullish by ""selling to the bears"": whether a trader chooses a debit or a credit spread might depend on their own level of bullishness, compared to the crowd. using the move for bearish strategies the same concepts apply to spreads with a bearish view, with debit spreads to the expected move helping lower costs and lower break-evens and credit spreads risking more to make less, but with a higher probability of profit compared to debits: using the move for income generating strategies finally, let's consider the scenario where you believe that the options market has overpriced the move and believe that the stock will stay within the expected move on a given timeframe. when ?selling the move', premium (or income) received from selling options is kept if the stock stays within a specific range. here's a look at an iron condor for this week's expiration in apple as an example of a neutral strategy that seeks to collect premium (income) if a stock stays within the expected move. in this example, the iron condor establishes a range of max gain for the trade if aapl stock closes anywhere between $135 and $152.50 on friday's expiry. while by no means the only basis for strike selection, setting condor strikes at the expected move is essentially taking the other side of option market consensus, while retaining the benefits of defined risk/reward. if the stock moves beyond $130 or $157.50, the trade results in a max loss. summary remember, the above are just examples of the many ways a trader might express a view using option spreads. they are intended solely to demonstrate how the expected move can provide actionable insight to consider before making any trade, particularly into an uncertain event. whether gut-checking your own expectations versus the options crowd, generating trade ideas from option market signals, or for more informed strike selection. that's why options ai puts the expected move at the heart of its chart-based platform. learn / options ai has a couple of free tools as well as education on expected moves and spread trading. the concepts shown in apple can apply to any stock and it is simply used here for illustrative purposes. the post facebook, apple, earnings and using spreads appeared first on options ai: learn. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingac.h. robinson worldwide: q4 earnings insightselon musk gets in on the gamestop fun, touts wallstreetbets in tweet?

1075,2021-01-27 10:43:10," shares of apple (nasdaq:aapl) increased by 31.93% in the past three months. before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt apple has. apple's debt according to the apple's most recent financial statement as reported on october 30, 2020, total debt is at $112.44 billion, with $98.67 billion in long-term debt and $13.77 billion in current debt. adjusting for $38.02 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $74.42 billion. let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. to understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. considering apple's $323.89 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.35. as a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. a higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. however, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. why debt is important debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. however, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital. looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios? check out benzinga pro, a market research platform which provides investors with near-instantaneous access to dozens of stock metrics - including debt-to-equity ratio. click here to learn more. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingaearnings scheduled for january 27, 202110 information technology stocks showing unusual options activity in today's session? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1079,2021-01-27 11:40:19," when investing in a fund, be it a mutual fund, index fund or exchange-traded fund, what's inside is of the utmost importance. after all, that's what determines investors' outcomes. what happened: the graniteshares xout u.s. large cap etf (nyse: xout) proves what's left matters, too. investors seem to agree because xout, which debuted in october 2019, recently topped $100 million in assets under management. ?xout takes a novel approach to passive etf investing by seeking to avoid losers being disrupted by technological innovation, rather than picking winners,? according to graniteshares. ?the xout methodology examines the 500 largest u.s. companies and excludes the bottom 250 stocks deemed most at risk using a rules-based, quantitative-driven framework.? why it's important: xout tracks the xout us large cap index. one of the pillars of the fund is eschewing stocks based on historical performance and avoiding companies that are ill-equipped to deal with changing, disruptive macro and market trends. data confirm xout's methodology works as the etf is higher by almost 31% over the past year. ?since fund inception, the xout index has returned 49.33% compared to the s&p 500?s 33.70% return, resulting in 15.63% outperformance,? according to graniteshares. proving what's left makes a difference, xout allocates just 0.04% of its weight to energy stocks and has no exposure to the utilities sectors. those were the two worst-performing groups in the s&p 500 last year. xout focuses on factors such as revenue growth, employee growth, reinvestment in company stock, earnings sentiment, research and development, management performance and profitability to determine what stocks should not make the cut. what's next: of course, what's included in xout matters, too. that includes a roughly combined 64% weight to the technology, consumer discretionary and communication services sectors, giving the fund a growth feel. some of xout's obvious growth components include amazon (nasdaq: amzn) and tesla (nasdaq: tsla). the fund also has plenty of quality with apple (nasdaq: aapl), microsoft (nasdaq: msft) and johnson & johnson (nyse: jnj) found among its top 10 holdings. xout charges 0.60% per year, or $60 on a $10,000 investment. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingatempting technology etf has plenty of 2021 tailwindsdouble the excitement: proshares new geared cloud computing, cybersecurity etfs? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1089,2021-01-27 14:59:52," in the current market session, apple inc. (nasdaq:aapl) is trading at $142.13, after a 0.72% drop. however, over the past month, the stock increased by 6.29%, and in the past year, by 75.55%. shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. the stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 2.04%. the p/e ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. a lower p/e indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. it shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. view more earnings on aapl most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. apple inc. has a better p/e ratio of 43.65 than the aggregate p/e ratio of 25.4 of the technology hardware, storage & peripherals industry. ideally, one might believe that apple inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued. price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingahow does apple's debt look?earnings scheduled for january 27, 2021? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1091,2021-01-27 15:09:59," this afternoon investors can sit back and enjoy an earnings season triple crown. tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla), apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), and facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) all deliver quarterly results after the close. before that, we?ll barely have time to digest a fed meeting and chew over last night?s results from microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft), starbucks corporation (nasdaq: sbux) and others. it?s a full, rich day. looking for a sense of what to expect when aapl, fb, and tsla report? there?s more detail on each right here on ticker tape, if you check our earnings preview page. this morning started with stocks backing away from recent highs in a pretty sharp downturn ahead of the open despite better than solid msft earnings (more below). a few things might be pushing stock indices down. first of all, there?s continued worries about the slowness of vaccines getting out. there also could be a little profit taking from the recent record highs. the third factor is this crazy action in gamestop corp. (nyse: gme), which might be making people nervous because they?re unclear what?s going on. today you?re seeing some of this same drama with shares of amc entertainment holdings inc (nyse: amc). it?s interesting what?s happening in these, but it might be better to be in the stands than on the field, so to speak. gme is trading on things people don?t understand. shares of gme accelerated again tuesday, jumping an incredible 92%?and doubled again in the overnight hours wednesday. there appears to be a short squeeze taking place?with at least two prominent short sellers announcing this morning they?ve covered their positions?but more dramatic moves can?t be ruled out. microsoft earnings receive a rowdy wall street welcome today we?ll see if microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) can bust out of a disappointing pattern it?s been in where the company reports great earnings and the stock pulls back. that didn?t appear to be the case wednesday, with shares up 1.5% in the overnight session after msft beat expectations on almost every metric with fiscal q2 results. you name the business area?personal computing, cloud, xbox?and msft shattered wall street?s projections. it?s pretty impressive to see the gaming segment rise 40% after the introduction of xbox series s and xbox series x. the cloud also looked very nice, with azure revenue up 50%. that?s compared with a 48% rise in the previous quarter, and when sequential growth gains steam from a base that was already so hot, it?s a good sign the business is thriving. overall intelligent cloud revenue of $14.6 billion came in nearly $1 billion ahead of the average street estimate. all told, the company?s $43 billion in revenue was around $3 billion above analysts? estimates and easily topped msft?s own guidance that had disappointed investors when it last reported in october. remember: a company can make a lot of adjustments to help dress up an earnings per share number, but it?s harder to hide a bad revenue reading. msft?s q2 revenue revealed a business that appears to be firing on all cylinders. starbucks corporation (nasdaq: sbux) reported after the close yesterday just as some large states like california and illinois eased their stay-at-home orders. restaurants in parts of these states reopened recently, but that doesn?t necessarily mean you can sit down and enjoy a coffee at the sbux near you. the company is keeping some stores closed for sit-down business based on its own ?heat map? of local conditions. the issue of closed stores might be hurting the u.s. business, where same-store sales slumped and overall revenue missed the street?s expectations. shares stumbled nearly 3% in pre-market trading. shares of advanced micro devices, inc. (nasdaq: amd) also stumbled despite a decent looking quarter. the company beat wall street estimates on top- and bottom lines, lifted by strong gaming demand. guidance also looked strong. the weak stock market response might reflect a buy the rumor, sell the fact situation, with the stock up 85% over the last year. the other big chip maker reporting yesterday was texas instruments incorporated (nasdaq: txn), and they also beat wall street projections. the semiconductor space is on a nice earnings run, but txn, like amd, didn?t enjoy a pre-market boost. it hit an all-time high last week. see more below on the chip sector. washington and the virus got pushed into the background a little with all the earnings news, but it was good to hear that johnson & johnson (nyse: jnj) plans to share its phase 3 vaccine results by early next week. fed meeting can?t be ignored, but big news not expected the fed meeting concludes at 2 p.m. et today, followed by fed chairman jerome powell?s press conference. analysts seem to agree that powell is going to re-emphasize the fed?s continued commitment to dovish policy and current levels of bond buying?one possible reason why treasury yields lost ground ahead of the meeting. it?s the fed so you have to pay attention, but it?s kind of hard to imagine much new coming out of this one. one difference is that for the first time in four years, the fed is meeting under a new president and treasury secretary. of course, the treasury secretary should be very familiar to fed watchers, with former fed chair janet yellen taking the helm this week. this potentially sets up more of a triumvirate than we saw over the last six months, when the trump administration wasn?t as clearly committed to new stimulus even as powell kept beating the drum for more fiscal response. yellen emphasized the importance of stimulus in her senate confirmation hearings. the triumvirate of president biden, yellen, and powell all pushing for more stimulus could be helped by a congress that now tilts just barely to the democrats. while there?s still a lot of maneuvering taking place on capitol hill around timing and size, powell now has more power behind the fed throne to take this fight to a higher level than he did, say, a month ago. it?ll be interesting to hear if he?s asked at the press conference about what size and shape he?d like an additional stimulus to take. he?ll probably also be pressed again on what sort of conditions the fed might want to see before beginning to taper some of the dramatic monetary accommodations it?s making. the cme?s fedwatch tool shows futures traders predicting no chance of a fed rate hike from until september at the earliest. chances for a hike by then aren?t exactly running too hot, at 6.1%. chart of the day: looking for support? the s&p 500 index (spx?candlestick) has wavered a bit over the last few sessions as it pivots near recent record highs. if selling gathers steam, one possible technical support point might be found at the 20-day moving average (blue line), which sits just below 3790. data source: s&p dow jones indices. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. talking technicals: the s&p 500 index (spx) is right near all-time highs, but there?s a hint that some of this incredible enthusiasm might be fading a bit. if the going gets muddier, one place to look for possible technical support is the 20-day moving average, which recently sat near 3790. that?s still a ways below the market, however. the spx dropped to its 20-day ma on jan. 15 and quickly rebounded. it also approached it and even fell under it for a few days in december and early january, but ?buy the dip? enthusiasm prevented any real chart damage from being done. the 50-day moving average is very close to the psychological 3700 level, so that could be another place to check for support on any sharper downward moves. semi-tough to pin down: pick a riddle, and it probably applies to semiconductors and the chip industry. you hold it in your hand every day but you never see it. you know what it does but not how it works. it?s one of the biggest industries in the world but you need a microscope to see it. and as we reported above, companies like amd and txn can beat on earning

1092,2021-01-27 15:16:23," each day, benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that happened on this date. what happened? on this day in 2010, apple, inc. (nasdaq: aapl) ceo steve jobs unveiled the first ipad. where was the market? the s&p 500 traded at 1,097.50 and the dow jones industrial average traded at 10,236.16. what else was going on in the world? in 2010, the u.s. congress passed the affordable care act, a healthcare reform bill also known as ?obamacare.? the explosion of the bp plc (nyse: bp) deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico triggered the largest marine oil spill in history. the average cost of a new house in the u.s. was $232,880. apple launches tablets: on jan. 27, 2010, apple unveiled its highly anticipated ipad tablet for the first time. just three years after the launch of the original iphone in 2007, ceo steve jobs was looking to prove that the massively successful apple smartphone wasn?t a fluke. the original pad was 0.5 inches thick, weighed 1.5 pounds and cost just $499. ?ipad creates and defines an entirely new category of devices that will connect users with their apps and content in a much more intimate, intuitive and fun way than ever before,? jobs said at the time. plenty of people were skeptical of the tablet format, which they saw at the time as more bulky than an iphone and less useful than a laptop. however, the ipad was a huge commercial success. apple reported $2.16 billion in ipad sales in the third quarter of 2010. by the first quarter of 2011, that number had jumped to $4.37 billion. in the first quarter of 2014, apple reported a record $11.46 billion in ipad sales alone. investors who bought apple shares on the day the ipad was unveiled are also very happy. since that day, apple?s total return has been 2,140% compared to just a 335% total return for the spdr s&p 500 etf trust (nyse: spy). photo credit: matt buchanan, via wikimedia commons see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingatesla and 9 other stocks that burned short sellers the most in 2020stock market winners, losers from biden's finance nominations? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1129,2021-01-27 20:22:14," ?risk-off? resurfaced in a major way wednesday, sending volatility soaring and stocks tumbling as the fed meeting ended and investors prepared for a triumvirate of tech earnings. concerns about the slow process of vaccination appeared to hurt the market, along with cautious words from the fed. wednesday?s losses for the major indices were the worst in three months, and banished the s&p 500 index (spx) into negative territory for 2021. small-caps and the dow jones industrial average ($dji) also took a hit, but the broader spx fell more sharply. a tough day at the (home) office fed chairman jerome powell said in his post-meeting press conference that it would be a long road to recovery, and that appeared to add to the late selling pressure on wall street. selling intensified toward the close as the spx plunged more than 2.5% to below what some analysts had seen as a technical support level that stood near 3750. meanwhile, the 10-year treasury yield sank to just above 1% by late in the session. it was at nearly 1.2% earlier this month. weakness in the 10-year yield put pressure on the financial sector, and so-called ?defensive? sectors, along with bonds, saw more buying interest. there had been this belief that a vaccine would be a magic potion that would sort of pick everything up, but powell put things in more realistic terms. it takes a while to recover, and that?s why rates remain unchanged and the fed?s bond-buying program continues. profit taking could be another factor in the selling, since major indices had all posted record highs this month. all this came ahead of apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla), and facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) earnings after the close. price action + earnings uncertainty = volatility the cboe volatility index (vix), sometimes seen as a measure of fear in the market, skyrocketed around 30% to above 30 after being below 22 last week. it?s the first time it?s taken out the 30 barrier since early november. a prolonged move above 30 in vix or below 1% in the 10-year yield would present a possible crossroads for either of those vectors. going through one or both of those lines could draw more sellers into stocks, or it could indicate to investors that maybe the selloff has gone far enough. wild activity around some ?short squeezes? this week in stocks like gamestop corp. (nyse: gme) might be another factor today. for some investors, it might signal a little froth in the market overall. as noted here a couple days ago, it?s absolutely normal for the major indices to have two or three 5% drops and at least one correction of 10% every year, and we haven?t seen anything close to that since last september when the spx fell about 9.6% over a few weeks. it would probably be less normal if things just kept going up without stopping, the way they had been since around early november. with investors shying away from risk on wednesday, and some of the more defensive sectors like staples and real estate did a little better than the overall indices. it?s also interesting to note that earnings season has been pretty decent so far, and the tech sector was one of the best performers today on a huge day for earnings in that sector. microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) results yesterday looked pretty stellar. meanwhile, ?reopening stocks? like walt disney co (nyse: dis), boeing co (nyse: ba), airline, and casino companies took a beating wednesday. some of the better performers included more ?defensive? stocks like campbell soup company (nyse: cpb), hewlett packard enterprise co (nyse: hpe), clorox co (nyse: clx), kroger co (nyse: kr), and 3m co (nyse: mmm). fed keeps zero-rate policy, says growth has ?moderated? not too surprisingly, the federal open market committee (fomc) signaled miniscule interest rates are here to stay as the u.s. economy continues to tiptoe on thin ice. what?s more, the fed also tried to provide reassurance that the ?t? word, as in taper, isn?t yet in the central bank?s vocabulary. we?re still far below the fed?s dual mandate of 2% inflation and maximum employment (see more below). the fed left the policy unchanged with the fed funds interest rates at 0?0.25%, where it?s been since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic last march. staying steady offered reassurance the fed will continue to support the economy?s recovery with low rates and bond purchases that won?t let up in the near future. today?s statement underscored how the balancing act is still being squared and any changes to the fed?s dovish stance aren?t coming any time soon. the policy statement repeated words we?ve heard before: letting inflation run ?moderately? ahead of the 2% goal to battle unemployment. one interesting change was that the fed left out some references to ?timing? from its statement. after its previous meeting in december, the fed said the health crisis ?will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.? today?s statement left out the words ?near term? and ?medium term? from that phrase. and instead of ?will continue,? the statement says, ?continues.? in powell?s press conference after the meeting, he said they took the word ?medium term? out because the issues the economy faces like vaccinations and new cases are all happening now. the words ?medium term,? he said, is more a description of what he called ?long-term scarring? to the economy. the fed added that the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, as it?s said in the past, but with the new phrase ?including progress on vaccinations,? added to that sentence. like the rest of us, the fed has a close eye on vaccine progress and can only be a spectator to that particular battle. powell?s still in the fed?s tool shed as a reminder, the fed?s monthly bond purchases have been coming in two forms: $80 billion in treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage-backed debt. powell said there?s no plan to change either anytime soon, and that if the fed does decide to go the tapering direction, it will give investors plenty of warning and do any tapering very gradually. the fed did this successfully after the 2008 financial crisis ended and has learned from that experience, he added. ?we think our policy stance is just right,? powell said. ?it?s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring. there?s strong activity in interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing, durable goods, and automobile sales. what?s holding the economy back isn?t lack of policy support from the fed, it?s the spread of disease.? powell acknowledged that inflation could potentially tick up a couple times in the near future. first, when the economy ?laps? the steep drop in prices seen last march and april, and then later in the year when presumably everything starts to open up. both of these inflation events will probably be ?transient,? powell said, and will ?likely pass.? he said investors can expect the fed to ?wait and see and not react? to any inflation from these events. the fed remains committed to getting inflation back to its 2% goal, and said the whole focus in the market on a possible taper ?is premature.? in his press conference, powell addressed the recent jump in jobless claims, the high number of people who remain unemployed due to the pandemic, and the slump in service sector jobs like ones at restaurants and hotels. chart of the day: bouncing off support. after finally breaking out above 1% which was a resistance level of an ascending triangle pattern (blue lines), the 10-year treasury index (tnx?candlestick) revisited that level today. today?s action shows it bouncing off that 1% level so it could now be acting as a support level. price action around that level could be something to keep an eye on. data source: cboe global markets. chart source: the thinkorswim?

1192,2021-01-28 08:59:48," tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) ceo elon musk said the company?s more than $800 billion valuation is justified as there is a ?roadmap? to it. what happened: musk?s back of the envelope math revolves around an assumed shipment of $50 or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles becoming full self-driving and get deployed as robotaxis. the usage of those cars would then jump from 12 hours a week to 60 hours a week, according to musk. the automaker would be able to garner additional fees for the use of these robotaxis, thus bringing in a new stream of revenue. the executive said that he suspects that some investors are taking that approach to valuing the company. why it matters: musk?s mathematics assumes a fivefold increase in the utility of the vehicles due to fsd, but even if there is a 2x increase, the $1 trillion valuation is still a probability. view more earnings on tsla see also: every time elon musk has warned investors about tesla's high share price ?it would be like if you made $50 million -- $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having $50 million of incremental profit basically from that because it's just software. so -- and the pace you get 20 pe on that, it's like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode,? said musk. this month virgin galactic holdings inc (nyse: spce) chairman and spac king chamath palihapitiya warned investors against selling tesla stock and said that tesla is a disruptive company and not just an automaker. palihapitiya said last year that tesla was ?misvalued.? the former facebook inc (nasdaq: fb) executive said that tesla could reach the scale of apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), which has a market cap of over $2.3 trillion. tesla reported q4 2020 and full-year results on wednesday. revenue rose 46% year-over-year to $10.74 billion for q4. revenue for the full fiscal 2020 was $31.54 billion ? a rise of 28% year-over-year. price action: tesla shares fell nearly 5% in the after-hours trading on wednesday to $820.39 after closing 2.14% lower at $864.16. click here to check out benzinga?s ev hub for the latest electric vehicles news. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingawallstreetbets gets shoutouts from cuban, portnoy, musk, aoc: who's saying whatgamestop investor michael burry ? of 'the big short' fame ? dubs rally 'unnatural, insane, and dangerous'? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1203,2021-01-28 10:02:43," apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) reiterated its stance of giving users privacy controls and options on limiting apps tracking their digital footprints, the wall street journal reports. the iphone maker will roll out the new privacy features in early spring, with a beta version out sooner for testing. the new software update to its mobile os would allow user ad tracking only if consumers opt-in. this means that companies like facebook, inc (nasdaq: fb), alphabet inc?s (nasdaq: goog) (nasdaq: googl), google, and others would not be able to collect a person?s advertising identifier without permission. tim cook is due to speak at the computers, privacy, and data protection conference on thursday on data privacy. facebook chief mark zuckerberg in his fourth-quarter earnings conference call, said that apple is one of its biggest competitors. ?imessage is a key linchpin of their ecosystem,? remarked zuckerberg. ?it comes pre-installed on every iphone and they preference it with private apis and permissions, which is why imessage is the most used messaging service in the u.s.? apple?s move has the app industry worried that opt-in requirements might lead many users to reject the request, resulting in the collapse of ad prices. price action: in the pre-market session on the last check thursday, aapl shares are down 2.24% at $138.88, and fb shares are down 0.57% at $270.60. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingaalphabet pops air out of internet balloon projecttwitter locks china embassy's account over tweet on uighur women? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1232,2021-01-28 15:08:11," apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) reported better-than-expected fiscal-year first quarter results, aided by strong iphone momentum, especially in china. the apple analysts: morgan stanley analyst katy huberty maintained an overweight rating on apple and increased the price target from $152 to $164. wedbush analyst daniel ives maintained an outperform rating and $175 price target. raymond james analyst chris caso reiterated an outperform rating and increased the price target from $150 to $160. needham analyst laura martin maintained a buy rating and hiked the price target from $140 to $170. why apple could be set for double-digit growth: the combination of larger installed base, fully refreshed product portfolio and continued working and learning from home trends suggest apple is on track to report strong double-digit growth over the next several quarters, morgan stanley's huberty said in a note. the iphone's strength, especially in china, and across-the-board services upside contributed most of the beat, and gross margin expanded about two points, the analyst said. although apple did not provide formal revenue guidance, it said it expects normal seasonal trends, suggesting revenue of about $76 billion to $78 billion, she said. this is about $3 billion ahead of the consensus, huberty said. the active device installed base growth accelerated from 7% a year ago to 10% and services monetization grew at the fastest rate in several years, the analyst said. customer loyalty remains well north of 90% across apple products, she said. morgan stanley now estimates 2020-2025 revenue cagr of 10%, thanks to accelerating installed base growth, improved services monetization and a recovery in china. higher gross margins are sustainable given growing fx tailwinds and a continued mix uplift across products, huberty said.

""iphone 12 success out of the gates was ?usain bolt-like' and is clearly on a path to meet the supercycle hype with iphone units that could easily eclipse the previous cupertino record from fy15 of 231 million units."" the all-important services business continues to fire on all cylinders and remains key to the re-rating in shares, he said. raymond james says apple delivered on all fronts: despite the late launch of iphone 12, more revenue was delivered in the december quarter versus what is estimated for the march quarter, caso said in a note. the analyst estimates that unit volume reached about 73 million, with an asp approaching $900, the analyst said. the total of december plus implied march guidance is 4% above rayjay's numbers and 7% more than consensus, he said. cupertino delivered on all fronts, including iphone, macs, wearables and services, caso said. ""while apple delivered on this cycle, we've long considered this to be a 2-year 5g cycle, with better global 5g coverage providing greater incentive for upgrades, along with what we expect to be a new form factor."" raymond james expects services to benefit from improving unit volume, which is adding to the installed base, along with new service offerings. installed base growth increases needham's optimism: apple should be valued as an ecosystem company owing to its seamless integration of hardware, software and content, needham analyst martin said. a key lead indicator to apple's upside value are the 1 billion unique iphone users owning 1.65 billion active devices at the end of 2020, the analyst said. deeper penetration of devices per home, she said, lowers churn and raises life time value, or ltv, per user. services adds high-margin incremental revenues to ltv, and also lower churn, martin said. subscription revenues add recurring revenues, and in the december quarter, apple added 35 million subscribers to 620 million paid subscribers, according to needham. aapl price action: apple shares were down 2.25% at $138.87 at last check thursday. related link: apple analyst: iphone manufacturer warrants premium to the s&p 500 photo courtesy of apple. latest ratings for aapl datefirmactionfromto jan 2021da davidsonmaintainsbuy jan 2021deutsche bankmaintainsbuy jan 2021wells fargomaintainsoverweight view more analyst ratings for aapl view the latest analyst ratings see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingaapple tops q1 earnings expectations as iphone, china strength lead to record revenuesapple earnings preview: on track to top 0b revenue amid strong uptake of iphone 12? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.
"
1233,2021-01-28 15:09:37," it seems like investors have plenty to mull over this morning, given the crazy action around apparent short squeezes, sobering comments about the economic recovery from the federal reserve, lofty stock valuations, and mixed economic news. the government?s first estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product came in under expectations, showing a 4% annualized gain when a briefing.com consensus had forecast a rise of 4.4%. but weekly jobless claims data, a more up-to-date measure of economic health than the backwards-looking gdp print, came in better than expected, with initial claims coming in at 847,000 compared to 875,000 forecast in a briefing.com consensus. although the jobless data was better than expected, it still shows a very high number of people out of work. investors have been getting increasingly jumpy about the economy amid an uneven vaccine rollout, and the overall state of worry seems to have worsened in recent days as concerns have grown about speculative trading, spilling over into losses overseas. with the disruption going on in the market right now related to apparent short squeezes, some investors may be taking profits on long positions to pay for losses in short positions, essentially selling winners to pay for losers and helping cause a readjustment of capital. at times like these, if you?re reassessing your own portfolio, it may be a good time to keep trades on the smaller side. earnings roundup turning to earnings, apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) opened its books on a blowout quarter yesterday after the closing bell. the tech giant?s quarterly revenue moved above $100 billion for the first time on double-digit sales increases in all of its business categories, and earnings came in handily above analyst expectations. notably, iphone sales rebounded on the back of interest in the new iphone 12 models. they had slumped the previous quarter as people waited for the new smartphones to come out. despite the amazing results, aapl shares were down more than 2% this morning. it seems likely that this is a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news sort of situation, and investors may be taking some profits from aapl?s run up in days prior to the earnings release. turning to another tech-related company, facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) shares were faring a bit better?near the flat line in the early going?after the social media company reported better-than-expected sales and profit. at the same time, the company said that a moderation or reversal in the pandemic-accelerated shift toward online shopping and goods could negatively impact advertising revenue, as could privacy changes in aapl?s mobile operating system. it seems this outlook is playing tug of war with the better-than-expected quarterly results to keep fb shares relatively flat this morning. tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) is another big tech-related company that reported quarterly results after the bell. its shares were down more than 5% this morning despite the electric vehicle maker?s revenue coming in ahead of expectations. although tsla had another profitable quarter, it?s earnings came in well under analyst expectations. plus, when you consider the incredible run recently in tsla shares, it might not be unexpected to see a little froth come off the top. wall street worry ratchets up risk sentiment took a hit on wednesday amid cautious words from the fed and apparent institutional selling associated with retail investor-sparked short squeezes. wall street?s main fear gauge, the cboe volatility index (vix) shot more than 60% higher to close at 37.21, its loftiest point since early november. with equities under pressure, investors moved into the relative safety of u.s. government debt, pressuring yields. a prolonged stay above 30 in the vix could present a possible crossroads for investors, potentially drawing more sellers into stocks. a nearly 4% loss in boeing co (nyse: ba) shares didn?t help market sentiment either. the aircraft manufacturer?facing delays in its 777x program amid engineering setbacks, the coronavirus travel slump, and extra scrutiny after the deadly 737 max crashes?reported a record yearly loss and took a $6.5 billion charge in the most recent quarter. although ba?s revenue was slightly better than analysts had expected, its per share loss was much larger than analysts had forecast. recovery seen taking time fed chairman jerome powell said in his post-meeting press conference that it would be a long road to economic recovery, and that appeared to add to late selling pressure on wall street. there had been this belief that a vaccine would be a magic potion that would sort of pick everything up, but powell put things in more realistic terms. it takes a while to recover, and that?s why rates remain unchanged and the fed?s bond-buying program continues. in powell?s press conference after the meeting, he said the central bank took the word ?medium-term? out of its policy language because the issues the economy faces like vaccinations and new cases are all happening now. the words ?medium term,? he said, are more a description of what he called ?long-term scarring? to the economy. the fed said that the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, as it?s said in the past, but added the new phrase ?including progress on vaccinations.? a fine line fed chairman jerome powell continues to walk a tightrope, balancing monetary accommodation as the pandemic lingers, but also keeping in mind the added debt load. the pandemic goes on, and now reports of a variant virus that may be more contagious are complicating the return to any kind of ?normal? we were accustomed to before the outbreak. this economic cloud of uncertainty continues even as arms get vaccination jabs. there are no guarantees enough people will get injections to bring us to a herd vaccination level. and who?s to say what variant viruses might bring? and the economic impact? sure, people are spending money, but consumer confidence is still hazy, rising modestly this month after a december dip. the gain in the conference board consumer confidence index to 89.3 from 87.1 in this week?s report was mostly attributed to the government?s pandemic relief checks sent out in late december. that?s a pattern repeating what happened after last year?s first round of stimulus checks. ?the slow rollout of the vaccines and the still-raging pandemic continue to depress consumer confidence despite the prospect of further fiscal aid and a brighter health situation,? kathy bostjancic, chief u.s. financial economist at oxford economics in new york, said of the conference board report. adding more grist is the weaker outlook for the job market after 900,000-plus jobless claims were made in the first week of january alone. chart of the day: the cboe volatility index (vix) shot higher wednesday as worry mounted about certain speculative trading as well as cautious words about the economic recovery from the fed. although one day doesn?t make a trend, the extra unease is coming amid questions about high market valuations and perhaps a more sober look at the vaccine rollout. data source: cboe global markets. chart source: the thinkorswim?

(nyse: gme) and amc entertainment holdings inc (nyse: amc) as apparent ?short squeezes? have contributed to massive gains for the stocks in a short time. but what exactly is a classic short squeeze? when an investor wants the ability to make money if a stock falls in value, they can borrow shares and then sell them. if shares fall as expected, the shorter can buy them back at the lower price, return them to the brokerage they borrowed from and count the difference (minus any interest on the borrowed shares) as profit. the problem comes when shares rise on unexpected bullish news, or as the case appears to be with gme and amc, unexpected speculation. in that scenario, investors who are short a

1238,2021-01-28 16:17:31," benzinga's premarket prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. et. during that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. on any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts joel elconin and dennis dick along with producer spencer israel. on some occasions, a good earnings report doesn't translate into a rally for a stock. with that being said, apple inc. (nasdaq: aapl) is the premarket prep stock of the day. great week ahead of the report: apple had one of its best weeks last week and the momentum carried over into monday?s session. the issue ended the jan. 15 session at $127.14 and ended last friday?s session at $139.07. the rally continued on monday, taking apple to a new all-time high at $145.09. it was unable to reach that level on tuesday but did post its all-time closing high on that day at $143.06. double-top and some profit-taking: on wednesday and thursday, apple put in a pair of highs ($144.30) and had a mild retreat. considering the beating the s&p 500 index took on wednesday, the retreat was minor in comparison. whereas the index sank 2.6%, apple was lower by only be less than 1%, falling from $143.16 to $142.06. view more earnings on aapl what is not to like? after the close on wednesday, the company reported quarterly earnings of $1.68 per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.41 by 19.15%. the company reported quarterly sales of $111.40 billion, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $103.28 billion by 7.86%. also, mac, ipad, wearable devices and services all improved significantly over the same quarter last year. price action: as expected off the stellar report, the issue caught a bid in the after-hours session. however, sellers emerged en masse when the issue was surpassing its all-time closing high ($143.16), when it peaked at $143.61 and reversed course. it ended after-hours trading just off the low for the session ($136.50) at $137.43. in the regular session as of 12:10 p.m. et, the issue has traded in just over a $2 range ($138 to $140.34) and is lower by $2 at $140.06. a full discussion on the issue from thursday?s show can be found here: see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingapremarket prep stock of the day: microsoftpremarket prep stock of the day: general electric? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1296,2021-01-29 13:31:36," the last day of a volatile and heavily traded stock market week opens this morning with investors apparently feeling uneasy given the state of certain speculative trades that have been in the spotlight for days. at the moment it seems like there is a little bit of turnover in the market, with people trying to determine how all this will shake out. in the meantime, with volatility already heightened, investors may want to be on the lookout for even more volatility because of options expiration. while the cboe volatility index (vix) did ease yesterday, it still closed above 30, and this morning is up roughly 14%. still, the selling in equities this morning isn?t as pronounced as it was earlier in the week. even though the vix is higher along with gold, which is widely considered a safe-haven investment in turbulent times, oil is higher and so is the yield on the 10-year treasury. the lower demand for u.s. government debt and increased willingness to buy a riskier asset like oil suggests that there is underlying support for the market once the hubbub about short squeezes dies down. turning to coronavirus-related developments, vaccine news has been mixed. novavax, inc. (nasdaq: nvax) said its vaccine showed more than 89% effectiveness, while johnson & johnson (nyse: jnj) said its covid-19 single-shot vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global phase 3 trial but showed 85% efficacy against severe disease. the vaccine was 72% effective against moderate and severe disease in the united states, the company said. the food and drug administration has indicated it would authorize a vaccine that?s safe and at least 50% effective. that?s a mouthful, but the main takeaway is jnj?s vaccine looks less effective than vaccines already out there. the question is how viable it is as another vaccine when others have more than 90% effectiveness. will people be ok taking one that?s below that? it remains to be seen, though jnj is putting a positive spin on the results and some analysts pointed out that 66% effectiveness is better than the flu vaccine. adjusting the dial noise. there?s a lot of it in the market these days. but as investors tune in to other aspects of the market besides heightened speculation in certain stocks, it seems they?re hearing things they like. for one thing, the earning season is generally going better than expected, raising hopes about the economic recovery. (see more on earnings below today?s chart.) in some of the latest mega cap earnings news, apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) hit the cover off the ball as its quarterly revenue surpassed $100 billion for the first time. facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb), another faang member, also reported better-than-expected sales and profit. american airlines group inc (nasdaq: aal), which has been beaten up amid the coronavirus-related travel slump, also surprised to the upside, posting a smaller-than-expected loss on revenue that beat forecasts. visa inc (nyse: v), which reported after the close thursday, also beat on top and bottom lines. the strong start to earnings season comes as investors still retain optimism about the economic recovery despite a slow and uneven vaccine rollout. although the government?s first crack at gdp showed the annualized figure for q4 coming in under expectations, it still showed a 4% gain. investors and traders apparently thought that was a decent-enough showing that they didn?t feel the need for stocks to sell off on the data. meanwhile, initial weekly jobless claims figures decreased for the second week in a row, perhaps stoking some hope that the numbers might keep coming down as vaccinations become more widespread. plus, with economic data improving but also showing we?re not out of the woods yet, it seems likely that investors and traders have been reminded for another time this week that the fed?s easy monetary policy is likely to continue for some time. next week?s earnings, economic data next week, earnings season rolls on with high profile reports from companies including alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl), amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn) and alibaba group holding ltd (nyse: baba). results from microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) earlier this week were pretty stellar as growth in its azure public cloud computing business increased for the third quarter in a row. with amzn, googl, and baba all involved in the cloud computing space, it could be interesting to see if cloud computing demand for them also surprises to the upside. the economic calendar next week includes manufacturing and service-sector numbers, construction spending data, and figures on factory orders. the weekly jobless claims report on thursday will probably again be closely watched as a barometer of the health of the economy during the pandemic. and the big data of the week comes on friday in the form of the government?s non-farm payrolls report. chart of the day: treasury bounce. as you might expect on a day when wall street fears were easing and stocks were in the green, demand for the benchmark 10-year treasury fell and the yield increased. it?s also interesting to note that the yield has bounced from a low just above 1% as seen in the 10-year treasury index (tnx?candlestick). that seems to be an important psychological number as interest rates remain low. data source: cboe global markets. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. earnings beats: investors seem to be generally encouraged as this earnings season turns out better than expected. a wednesday report from zacks investment research said that more than 83% of the 114 s&p 500 index (spx) companies that had reported by then had beaten earnings-per-share estimates. more than 77% had beaten revenue estimates, the research company said. ?this is a notably better performance than we have seen from the same group of companies in the first three quarters of the year,? the note said. another research firm, factset, said on thursday that earnings beat rates remain elevated but have trended lower. it seems that trend might be worth watching, but for the moment investors seem generally pleased with this earnings season. cautiously optimistic: in a bit of good news on the economic recovery front, the international monetary fund this week upwardly revised its outlook for 2021 global economic growth by 0.3 percentage points to 5.5%. the imf said it expects a vaccine-powered strengthening later this year and additional policy support from a few large economies. but the imf was also cautious in its outlook, saying that renewed waves and new variants of covid-19 pose concerns. ?the strength of the recovery is projected to vary significantly across countries, depending on access to medical interventions, effectiveness of policy support, exposure to cross-country spillovers, and structural characteristics entering the crisis,? the imf said. carbon trading: north america?s small regional carbon markets have been growing, even before news that the united states has begun the process of rejoining the paris climate agreement. expectations of policy changes that will result in tighter future carbon market balances helped the overall market value of the western climate initiative and the regional greenhouse initiative to grow by 16% in 2020 over 2019 levels, to roughly $26 billion and about $2 billion respectively, according to refinitiv. still, those markets are dwarfed by the european emissions trading system, which accounted for about 90% of the roughly $277 billion total value of the global carbon market in 2020. td ameritrade? commentary for educational purposes only. member sipc. photo by m. b. m. on unsplash see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingafebruary outlook: six things to look for include fed testimony, vaccine progress, big-box earningsthe tech earnings barrage: earnings beats by apple, facebook; more big tech companies report next week? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not pro

1310,2021-01-29 18:19:00," when you create a product that?s efficient, effective, and well-branded it can become peoples? top choice, and that favorability could pose a significant barrier to entry. the downside: you might be accused of having a monopoly on your hands and face a basket of antitrust lawsuits. that pretty much sums up google?s parent company, alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl). after facing pandemic headwinds in q2 of 2020 resulting in the company?s first-ever year-over-year quarterly revenue decline, googl got back on its feet in q3, crushing analyst expectations in just about every business segment. the road through q4 looked promising, but then the search behemoth found itself broadsided with antitrust lawsuits from the justice department and 38 other states and territories. googl?s ?monopoly? problem may arguably dampen investor sentiment. but let?s face it: the trial isn?t taking place until september 2023, and investor attention spans tend to fall on the short-term side of things. that means the focus might be more on googl?s previous quarter and the ones ahead this year. could all this be nothing more or less exciting than business as usual? we?ll find out when googl reports q4 earnings after the bell on feb. 2. figure 1: sector tracking. shares of alphabet (googl?candlestick) have pretty much been moving in sync with the communication services sector ($ixc?purple line). it?ll be interesting to see how well the two correlate after googl announces its q4 earnings. data source: nasdaq, s&p dow jones indices. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. it?s open season for online ad space the exciting news leading into the last quarter of 2020 was that search and youtube ad revenues had bounced back in a big way during q3. the drop in ad spending?nearly 80% of the company?s entire revenue?hit googl like a ton of bricks in q2 amid the lockdown. even though people at home relied heavily on online search and streaming entertainment via youtube?making ?online? the ideal stage for attention and engagement?many businesses were temporarily shuttered; most looking to cut expenses amid economic uncertainty. when you consider those challenges, the drop in ad spend was understandable. but if economic gloom prevented businesses from spending or doubling-down on their ad efforts, googl?s q3 ad revenue of $37.1 billion?jumping 10% year over year from q2?s negative 8%?might have indicated early on that the space was, once again, about to be re-engaged. googl may be the dominant player in search-based advertising and it may also hold a huge chunk of market share through its streaming youtube platform. but the global share of online advertising, estimated at $389 billion in 2021 alone according to statista, still presents a wide field of opportunity. in short, there?s lots of room for growth. and the time seems ripe to take the field, as vaccine rollouts and continued stimulus support encourage businesses to try to get back to business as usual. did googl take the opportunity to make a quick move on the renewed advertising season? that?s something investors will have to listen for when googl opens its books. plenty of room for clouds in the virtual sky googl is a huge company with a real penchant for disruption and innovation. but in the cloud space, it?s a small catcher-upper, trailing well behind leaders amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn) and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft). to date, googl?s cloud makes up only a little over 7% of its total revenue. but what matters most in googl?s catch-up game isn?t the size of its cloud share but its growth rate. in q3, its cloud revenue may have been up only $3.4 billion, small compared to amzn?s $11.6 billion or msft?s $13 billion revenue for cloud. but if you take a look at the growth rate, googl?s q3 cloud revenue grew 45% year over year, as compared with amzn?s 29% and msft?s 20%. googl?s pursuit reminds us of a slogan (and book title) that captures the spirit of innovation in early tech, not unlike googl in its early years: ?it?s not the big that eat the small ... it?s the fast that eat the slow.? keep this in mind when googl reports cloud revenues in the coming quarter, as google cloud, a segment ceo sundar pichai is aggressively driving, will be reported as its own stand-alone segment. alphabet earnings and options activity googl is expected to report an adjusted eps of $15.93, up from $15.35 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. revenue is projected at $53.1 billion, up 15.2% from a year ago. the options market has priced in an expected share price move of 4.3% in either direction around the earnings release. looking at the feb. 5 options expiration, call activity has been spread out, but with a concentration at the 1900 strike. put activity has also been spread out with the most active at the 1700 strike. the implied volatility sits at the 32nd percentile as of friday morning. note: call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. in ?other? news ... googl?s ?other bets,? its smaller projects and subsidiaries including waymo, its driverless vehicle tech, and verily life sciences brought in $178 million in q3 revenue, nearly 15% more than a year earlier. however, it also generated a q3 operating loss of $1.1 billion?up 17% from the same quarter the prior year. googl also finalized its acquisition of electronic consumer and fitness company fitbit a few weeks ago. results of that acquisition will likely be reported in the quarter to come. looking ahead in q3, googl crushed analyst expectations, with earnings per share of $16.40 topping analyst estimates of $11.29, and revenue of $46.17 billion versus estimates of $42.90 billion according to research firm refinitiv. though analysts largely expect to see a year over year decline in communications services net profit margins, according to factset, analysts expect googl to outperform its sector peers. research firm cfra noted the company?s dominance in search and streaming (youtube) ad revenues as primary drivers. though googl cfo ruth porat withheld guidance for q4, she emphasized the company?s continued investment in segments offering ?long-term sustainable financial value? particularly cloud growth. will googl offer any guidance this time out? it?s possible, but other tech companies, including apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), decided not to, citing uncertainty around the pandemic. td ameritrade? commentary for educational purposes only. member sipc. options involve risks and are not suitable for all investors. please read characteristics and risks of standardized options. photo by christian wiediger on unsplash see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingainvestors eye vaccine results from jnj, novavax amid broader market uncertaintyfebruary outlook: six things to look for include fed testimony, vaccine progress, big-box earnings? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1313,2021-01-29 20:17:42," you could argue that the market spooked itself this week. now it wasn?t as if there weren?t external reasons for the downturn. between worries about slow vaccine rollout, weak european economic data, the appearance of the south african variant of the virus here, and a few disappointing earnings reports, it?s easy to find a fundamental story to blame. still, it feels like the selloff, which accelerated friday as the s&p 500 index (spx) fell nearly 2%, was more of a reaction to internal market developments. anyone who?s paid attention knows about all the focus on short squeezes that brought fame (and some fortune) to stocks like gamestop corp. (nyse: gme) and amc entertainment holdings inc (nyse: amc). there?ve been disruptions all over the world, and now the stock market is feeling some disruption and a change of tone. the short squeezes certainly had a lot to do with it. the way people interact with the market is a little different than in the past. there?s also a sense that things in general had come too far, too fast, sending values too high and leading to calls for a little consolidation. basically, the four main stock indices had rolled along full steam ahead with hardly a break since early november, and that made some people nervous, especially about valuations. the short squeezes seemed to reinforce some investors? beliefs that it was time for a little profit-taking. it?s a storm of a lot of things coming together that?s leading to a disruption in the market overall. these kinds of disruptions occur every 10 or 12 years and the market has always survived them. people are reassessing their portfolios. not just individuals, but funds, too. there?s a reassessment of value everywhere. some of the major stocks leading the downward charge friday included all the ?faangs? along with microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft). apple inc (nasdaq: aapl)?which often has an outsized impact on the overall market due to its huge valuation?is down 8.5% since reaching an all-time high early this week. that?s despite a stellar earnings report. that?s the kind of thing that makes you wonder if we?re seeing some good old-fashioned profit-taking. from a sector standpoint, it looks like a few of the ones that had been doing best on the recent rally have fallen the hardest, including energy, info tech, and financials. the so-called ?defensive? sectors, including utilities and health care, did best on friday. bumpy ride not out of the ordinary it never feels good to lose money in the market, but it should feel familiar. major indices generally experience several 5% drops each year and usually at least one 10% decline. the spx hadn?t had any sort of serious backtracking since september when it fell around 9.6% from its highs. then it went on a tear, chalking up gains of nearly 18% from the end of october up to its all-time highs earlier this month. gains were even heavier for the small-cap russell 2000 index (rut), which entered this week trading at about 1.37 times its 200-day moving average, the highest it?s been relative to the 200-day since at least 2000. hopes for further fiscal stimulus, the fed?s dovish monetary policy (which it again promised this week to keep that way for the long term), and vaccine progress all helped electrify wall street between november and january. now it feels like maybe things got a little ahead of themselves, considering all the challenges we still face. europe is running low on vaccines. the u.s. rollout has been slower than expected. the johnson & johnson (nyse: jnj) vaccine data today looked ok, but not amazing, and none of the vaccines seem to be as effective against this south african variant that has medical experts sounding nervous. gross domestic product (gdp) growth in q4 wasn?t quite as good as some people had hoped and moderated from the breakneck pace of q3. combine all that with earnings from facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb) and tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) that didn?t blow anyone out of the water, cruise lines once again pushing back their schedules, a bond market that showed new life, rising volatility, and an spx valuation at historic highs, and it would have been kind of weird not to have some weakness in stocks. key levels to watch include 30,000 in $dji and 3700 in spx despite this disappointing end to the week, try to keep things in perspective. the spx is still up 13.5% in the last three months, and remains around 3.5% below this month?s all-time highs. if a market correction is defined as a 10% decline from the high, we?re not even halfway there yet. that might feel reassuring in one sense, but it should also mean caution. there could be more weakness ahead if this downturn is going to become a correction, which can?t be ruled out. the argument against that is there just hasn?t been a lot of interest among investors to really push the market down over the last few months. every time the spx dropped to its 20-day moving average since nov. 1, it met new buyers in what became called a ?buy the dip? trade. this week the spx actually did fall below the 20-day and then tested the 50-day moving average, which was 3715 heading into friday (see chart below). the question heading into next week is whether any technical support in that area holds, or if selling picks up. longer-term technical support is in a range between 3633 and 3695, according to research firm cfra. this is where the ?buy the dip? crowd meets a test: will they still want to buy the dip after the main crunch of earnings season ends and the world continues to stumble trying to fight the pandemic? the two big numbers to watch could be 30,000 in the dow jones industrial average ($dji) and 3700 in the spx. the two indices flirted with those levels late friday, and the $dji ultimately closed just below 30,000. if it hops back above there monday and manages to hold on, that would probably be seen as a technical victory that could promise a little recovery ahead. it?s kind of interesting that all this happened at a time when you could point to some actual positive developments in the background. microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) and apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) both reported earnings that are about as solid as it gets and next week brings alphabet (googl) and amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn). other big names penciled into the earnings lineup next week include paypal holdings inc (nasdaq: pypl), alibaba group holding ltd (nyse: baba), united parcel service, inc. (nyse: ups), and peloton interactive inc (nasdaq: pton). we?ll talk more about those reports and what to look for in them on monday morning. as these companies report, stimulus traction appears to be growing on capitol hill. media coverage this week suggested democrats might try to speed the $1.9 trillion legislation through congress through reconciliation, which wouldn?t necessarily require republican votes. whatever you might think of the legislation itself, stimulus generally appears to have helped the stock market over the last few months. next week we?ll see if it elbows its way back into the headlines in a big way, which has potential to be a helpful force for the market. volatility explosion could keep investors cautious what?s not helpful is the way volatility just exploded this week. on one day, the cboe volatility index (vix) skyrocketed to 37 from below 22. this isn?t something you often see, and overall the vix had its biggest upside week since june. historically, vix?sometimes called the market?s ?fear index??trades in ranges over periods of time. it spent a lot of time last fall between 25 and 30, and then early this year between 20 and 25. now it?s back above 30, and that could indicate more concern about possible choppiness and deeper losses straight ahead. one interesting thing now vs. a week ago, however, is that vix futures have gone from contango (where outer months are higher than the current level) to backwardation, where the current level outweighs future prices. it was also positive to see the major indices bounce off of their lows late in friday?s session, which could have po

1341,2021-01-31 01:10:59," (bloomberg) -- english premier league soccer club manchester city are well-known for spending big in their pursuit of trophies. yet this winter?s key signing is not a new striker or a commanding defender, it?s a hedge fund veteran with a doctorate in astrophysics.laurie shaw?s r?sum? is straight from high-brow science and finance. he studied such things as dark matter halos and galaxy clusters at cambridge and yale universities before moving to data science at harvard via london-based algorithmic investment firm winton capital management and the u.k. treasury. then soccer came calling.while the marriage of sport and data in the pursuit of marginal gains is hardly new, shaw?s move appears be the latest escalation in the battle among top teams for an edge in the world?s most lucrative competitions. it?s all the more striking because manchester city is expected to close out the month-long transfer window for trading players on feb. 1 without making any significant on-field additions.the 39-year-old manchester native will lead ai insights at parent company city football group. he will focus on building machine-based models to better manage player fatigue, injury and illness. his will also work on player identification, recruitment and individual development, pre and post-match analysis and recruitment of coaches.?more so than ever, the plan for the team off the pitch is arguably more critical to success than any other element,? said trevor watkins, global head of sport at pinsent masons, a law firm that recently advised on u.s. investment company alk capital?s acquisition of premier league team burnley.shaw will work with the manchester city group?s 11 clubs in five continents stretching from new york to melbourne. he joins an expanding team that already includes a performance physicist.last season, city lost out to rival liverpool in the race for the premier league championship after winning it four times since the takeover of the club by a member of the abu dhabi royal family, sheikh mansour bin zayed bin al nahyan, in 2008.liverpool has also pushed heavily into data science, a strategy seen as contributing to its first league title in 30 years. bookmakers currently make manchester city favorite to prevail this season.data-driven player investment has led to an ?arms race for phd statistics and physics talent,? said paul conway, director of pacific media group. the company owns second-tier english club barnsley, where billy beane, the data science guru who inspired the book and film ?moneyball,? is a director.?we fully expect in the next few seasons?like it?s embraced in baseball?that these phds will also be on the pitch, in uniform and computer in hand, advising coaches on real-time match decisions,? said conway.manchester city, which typically unveils new signings with a slick media campaign, played down shaw?s arrival. the club declined a request for an interview and didn?t comment on the details of shaw?s role.that?s not to say there?s no soccer pedigree, albeit from behind a computer screen. shaw has been running a blog, called eightyfivepoints, dedicated to ?two things i spend a substantial amount of my time doing: analyzing data and following football.? he gets editing help from his brother?a liverpool fan.for more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 bloomberg l.p.

(see chevron stock analysis on tipranks) following the results, raymond james analyst justin jenkins maintained a buy rating and a price target of $112 (25.8% upside potential) on the stock, ?based on a more secure balance sheet, solid leverage to a macro/oil price recovery and capital allocation that is already aligned with investor preferences.? in a note to investors, jenkins wrote, ?efficiency drivers are set to improve profitability into 2021, while a 'block and tackle' capital program over the next few years should further improve competitiveness, even without more help from the macro environment.? meanwhile, the rest of the street has a cautiously optimistic outlook, with a moderate buy consensus rating based on 10 buys and 4 holds. the average analyst price target of $104.15 implies upside potential of about 22.2% to current levels. shares were down about 19% in the previous year. furthermore, tipranks' data shows that financial bloggers have a bullish call on the stock. related news: mondelez?s 4q profit beats analysts? estimatesstreet is bullish honeywell?s 4q profit tops estimates juniper?s 4q sales top street estimates; shares dip more recent articles from smarter analyst: wells fargo ceo?s annual salary falls 12% on weak 4q results honeywell?s 4q profit tops estimates academy sports & outdoors prices secondary offering at $21.50; shares drop altria tops quarterly revenues, approves $2b share buyback plan

(nasdaq: bbby) stall out at $53.90 for no reason? heck no. back in early 2016, the issue had a pair of monthly highs at the $52.50 area. the bagholders in the issue ? who were stuck with a huge losing issue for years in the greatest bull market of all-time ? were getting bailed out. does this necessarily mean that the stock is not going back to that high or $100, $200 or $500? no. but what you have now is a whole new set of bagholders who are waiting to get out. since peaking at $53.90 on wednesday, the issue traded down to $30.08 on thursday and briefly traded over $40 in friday?s session. how many investors are hoping it gets back to $50 for a scratch or to eke out a small profit? broken markets: whether you believe it or not, the markets are broken for now. for those who cheer the demise of hedge funds and large trading institutions, be careful what you wish for. they are the ones that provide liquidity in the markets, and if you think they all are getting smoked now, you are mistaken. the real demon in the house is payment for order flow, which has enabled brokerage firms to offer free trading. these firms are still making money ? not from commissions, but by selling their order flow. the solution? there isn?t one. sec inquiries and investigations may uncover a few of the culprits in the schemes, but the cat is out of the bag. to be clear, this is not new. for years, hedge funds have beat up on each other in the markets for gains. the only difference is that the power is with the masses, and some of these same tactics are being used on a large scale. we are already witnessing the devastating impact this is having on the markets. if it continues in this direction, all investors large and small will suffer in the end. a more in-depth discussion on this topic from friday?s premarket prep show can be found here: premarket prep is a daily trading show hosted by prop trader dennis dick and former floor trader joel elconin. you can watch premarket prep live every day from 8-9 a.m. et benzinga's youtube channel, and the podcast is on spotify, itunes, google play, soundcloud, stitcher and tunein. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingapremarket prep stock of the day: applepremarket prep stock of the day: microsoft? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1416,2021-02-01 13:08:24," shares of apple (nasdaq:aapl) saw some unusual options activity on monday. following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $134.22. sentiment: bullish option type: sweep trade type: call expiration date: 2021-03-19 strike price: $135.00 volume: 2946 open interest: 148338 three ways options activity is ?unusual' one way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. the volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. in other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. understanding sentiment options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. the activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. for the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. trading options with these strategies unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account. for more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alerts see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzinga10 information technology stocks with unusual options alerts in today's session10 information technology stocks showing unusual options activity in today's session? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1417,2021-02-01 13:10:52," last week?s volatility and market disruption can take a long time to settle down, so strap in. the new month starts with wall street in an unfamiliar position: down for the year. friday?s selloff accelerated a turnaround that began earlier in the week, putting a red mark on the major indices? january performance. heading into monday, the s&p 500 index (spx) was down 1.1% so far in 2021, with the nasdaq (comp) off 1.4% and the previously high-flying russell 2000 index (rut) down a sharp 5%. keep things in perspective, though. the spx is up about 66% from last year?s lows, and nothing can climb forever without a break. despite all the wild action last week and so much uncertainty about what would happen?even with the inner workings of the market itself?the market rallied back overnight, and trading seems to be going normally this morning. there may be margin restrictions from some firms, but otherwise it looks like typical trading. like ringing a bell: volatility not necessarily departing some of last week?s turbulence and volatility survived the weekend into sunday night and early monday. if you were watching the futures market, maybe you noticed how the major indices were down sharply last night before reversing course and charging higher ahead of the opening bell. usually when there?s trading like we saw last week, it doesn?t get right back to normal, so you probably shouldn?t expect that. instead, this volatile trading is like a big bell ringing?the reverberations can last a while. more volatility is almost certainly ahead, along with the chance of some dramatic swings back and forth. anyone planning on trading the market right now should consider taking extra caution and possibly keeping trade sizes smaller than normal. volatility is slightly lower this morning but that won?t necessarily last. the cboe volatility index (vix) is still well above 30, compared with the historic average near 20. there?s also a strange relationship going on early today with volatility down but bonds up. in addition, the bond market is on the rise even while stocks rallied an amazing amount from their lows overnight. there?s a disconnect between the bond and the equity market at the moment, so we?ll have to see what the outcome is. it?s not like the bond market is exactly flashing caution, but bonds and vix being up reinforce the chance for volatile trading. it?s a big earnings week and we?ve got a lot of data coming, too, including friday?s monthly jobs report. two faangs?alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl) and amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn)?step up to the plate tomorrow afternoon. the hits keep coming. then there?s the elephant in the room. anyone paying any attention at all knows about the focus on short squeezes that brought fame (and some fortune) to stocks like gamestop corp. (nyse: gme) and amc entertainment holdings inc (nyse: amc). there?ve been disruptions all over the world, and now the stock market is feeling some disruption and a change of tone. the short squeezes certainly had a lot to do with it. the way people interact with the market is a little different than in the past. there?s a storm of a lot of things coming together leading to a disruption in the market overall. these kinds of disruptions occur every 10 or 12 years and the market has always survived them. despite the disappointing end to last week, try to keep things in perspective. the spx is still up 13.5% in the last three months, and remains around 3.5% below this month?s all-time highs. if a market correction is defined as a 10% decline from the high, we?re not even halfway there yet. that might feel reassuring in one sense, but it should also mean caution. there could be more weakness ahead if this downturn is going to become a correction, which can?t be ruled out. the argument against that is there just hasn?t been a lot of interest among investors to really push the market down over the last few months. every time the spx dropped to its 20-day moving average since nov. 1, it met new buyers in what became called a ?buy the dip? trade. last week the spx actually did fall below the 20-day and then ended slightly below the 50-day moving average near 3716 (see chart below). the question heading into this week is whether any technical support in that area holds, or if selling picks up. earnings parade still gathering steam it?s kind of interesting that all this happened at a time when you could point to some actual positive developments in the background. microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) and apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) both reported earnings that are about as solid as it gets and this week brings alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl) and amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn). other big names penciled into the earnings lineup this week include paypal holdings inc (nasdaq: pypl), alibaba group holding ltd (nyse: baba), united parcel service, inc. (nyse: ups), and peloton interactive inc (nasdaq: pton). the pton report could be interesting for insight on how the company plans to handle things once people get back to normal following the pandemic. pton has done well with everyone stuck at home, but will demand remain this strong once people are comfortable going back to the gym? the ups earnings are probably worth a close look for what they might say about the consumer economy, especially considering the quarter included the holiday season. speaking of which, amzn earnings could give clues into holiday sales, too, as well as a look at how amzn?s cloud growth did in a very competitive environment where amazon web services (aws) remains the leader. msft?s cloud growth was huge in its recent quarter. pypl could be interesting for what, if anything, they have to say about cryptocurrency. penn national gaming, inc (nasdaq: penn) is another one to look out for this week with so much interest in the gaming sector since we all got sent home. chart of the day: finding new support. after bouncing off its support of the 20-day moving average (yellow line), the s&p 500 index (spx?candlestick) broke below it on wednesday and has traded below it since then. it?s now moved down to its 50-day moving average (blue line) and closed just a hair below it at 3714.18. it?s too early to tell if this will be the next support level but it?s something to keep an eye on. data source: s&p dow jones indices. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. lots of numbers: data-wise, investors might want to keep their eyes open this morning for the latest on construction spending and the ism manufacturing index. the manufacturing sector has generally had a good performance lately, and the ism headline number last time out was the highest since 2018 at 60.7%. the employment index also grew. analysts expect the headline number to be just a bit lower for january at 60.1%, according to research firm briefing.com. the big data gorilla this week is employment on friday. jobs are always the number one number to watch, and last month?s report was disappointing. a lot of the losses were in just one sector, however?with leisure and hospitality positions falling by nearly 500,000 in december. we?ll dig more into expectations for the january report later this week. technical picture: the two big numbers to watch this week could be 30,000 in the dow jones industrial average ($dji) and 3700 in the spx. the two indices flirted with those levels late friday, and the $dji ultimately closed just below 30,000. if they hop back above those levels today and manage to hold on, that would probably be seen as a technical victory that could suggest a little recovery ahead. longer-term technical support is in a range between 3633 and 3695, according to research firm cfra. this is where the ?buy the dip? crowd meets a test: will they still want to buy the dip after the main crunch of earnings season ends and the world continues to stumble trying to fight the pandemic? a second look at j&j data: the vaccine data from johnson & johnson (nyse: jnj) released on

1466,2021-02-02 11:10:42," with all of the activity happening in the market at the moment, it sometimes goes unappreciated that we are knee-deep in earnings season. solid deliveries from market constituents like facebook inc. (nasdaq: fb) and apple inc. (nasdaq: aapl) as well as a slew of positive earnings from financials like jpmorgan chase & co. (nyse: jpm) and morgan stanley (nyse: ms) have primed the pump for more upside surprises as companies close the books on a tumultuous 2020. nevertheless, the recent volatility in the market has somewhat overshadowed the impact of these results as the market?s physics grapple with the activity of retail traders buying and selling stocks as a weapon against hedge funds and institutional traders. individual traders hoping to navigate this earnings season in the midst of the market?s current unpredictability would do well to not only look at the fundamentals of these companies, but also analyze their recent chart performance using institutional-quality software like that from trading research firm vantagepoint. an upcoming free virtual demo of vantagepoint?s software will look to illustrate, using predictive charting and advanced a.i. technology, how traders can improve their accuracy and discover new opportunities in a seemingly unpredictable market. in anticipation of the free demonstration, we?ll take a look at some of the big reports incoming through the remainder of the q4 earnings delivery season and how those deliveries might stack up against the current earnings environment and overall market ecosystem. high expectation, low reward this month?s early earnings themes will be dominated by results from major technology and biotechnology names. this week alone will see incoming results from tech heavy-hitters like amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn), alphabet, inc. (nasdaq: goog) and alibaba group holdings, ltd. (nyse: baba), all of which are set to deliver results at the close of tuesday?s session. they are all also anticipated to post year-over-year revenue results of anywhere from 15%-50% over this same period last year. grab your vip seat for vantagepoint's free online training here there are similarly high expectations for semiconductor companies like qualcomm incorporated (nasdaq: qcom), reporting after wednesday?s close, and nvidia corporation (nasdaq: nvda), which is scheduled to report after the february 16 trading session. while that may seem like cause for bullishness in the technology space, keep in mind that apple inc. (nasdaq: aapl) posted similarly strong results in its earnings announcement last week. it has since traded lower by -5%. obviously fundamentals are not the overriding predictor for stock performance, and predictive charting could help incorporate some of that middling response for upcoming earnings. one area that might show better post-earnings performance is the pharmaceutical and biotech space. johnson & johnson?s (nyse: jnj) q4 earnings beat from last week put some pep in the company?s stock chart, and incoming results from biogen inc. (nasdaq: biib) during premarket wednesday and bristol-myers squibb company (nyse: bmy) and merck & co., inc. (nyse: mrk) prior to thursday?s open could do the same if they too are able to surprise on the upside. consumer and retail brands could surprise nevertheless, the fact remains that the market seems hesitant to reward stocks in high growth industries like tech and biotech, many of which have spent the latter half of 2020 outpacing the broad market by surging to new highs. while those market leaders may be in a holding pattern following their impressive gains throughout much of last year, incoming reports from consumer stocks may carry the right combination of earnings optimism and upside potential to spur some new buying in the event of an excellent report. incoming results from consumer staples the coca-cola company (nyse: ko) and pepsico, inc. (nyse: pep) are anticipated february 10th and 11th in the premarket sessions. while the former sustained a significant revenue loss through 2020 compared to 2019, both companies are coming off of solid q3 numbers, and pep is on pace for revenue growth in a year where not all companies can say that. join vantagepoint's free live online training session to see how to use a.i. in your trading depending on results and market reaction following ko and pep?s reports, a similar story may play out in two other beverage staples set to report later in february, anheuser-busch inbev sa/nv (nyse: bud) and ambev s.a. (nyse: abev), which will deliver their q4 number on february 25th during the premarket. the consumer will take the spotlight for several retail names that report toward the back half of the month into march, including walmart inc. (nyse: wmt) on the 18th, home depot (nyse: hd) on the 23rd and costco wholesale corporation (nyse: cost) on march 4th. these consumer stocks have all seen consolidation in the first month of the year, so they may have the potential to gain upside traction in the event of strong sales figures. of course, the current market is hard to anticipate, and traders should leverage whatever tools and data they can lay their hands on to get an advantage. vantagepoint?s software is designed to improve trading accuracy up to 87.4% using the same technology used by institutional traders. click here to sign up for a free demonstration of the tools available on vantagepoint and see whether they might work for you. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingawhy 2021 may see the resurgence of u.s. industrialsflowerhire and engin sciences host virtual talent conference to launch careersincannabis.com? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1482,2021-02-02 12:59:30," the big story last week was a dramatic spike in volatility. today, that appears to be unwinding quickly, perhaps lending some initial strength to the stock market. futures on the major indices are advancing in the early going, and the cboe volatility index (vix) has moved back to the ?calm side? of 30, starting the day with a 27 handle. the plunge in volatility came as a couple of the big speculative plays from the last few days also appeared to come unwound. gamestop corp. (nyse: gme) shares collapsed 40% in pre-market trading. silver is also getting pounded, a day after what looked like a mini-boom. hopes for progress on a fiscal stimulus and a generally positive earnings picture could be injecting new life and helping investors put last week?s crazy trading behind them, at least early on. it?s another action-packed earnings day on wall street, dominated by amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn) and alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl) after the close. don?t forget pfizer inc. (nyse: pfe) this morning, which might be a good chance for an update on vaccine progress and production.\ looking at the early earnings scorecard today, alibaba group holding ltd (nyse: baba) beat analysts? estimates across the board but the stock?s down a little. pfe raised its view for the year, which is good. united parcel service, inc. (nyse: ups) numbers didn?t look great at first glance but the company had a one-time charge. beyond that it looked like a solid quarter. exxon mobil corporation (nyse: xom) also had good earnings. overall, we seem to be having a good earnings season, not a great one. people are happy to see progress and hear ceos talking about good things to come. stocks haven?t been getting a major bump from earnings results, but there was a big runup going into the season, which could explain that. turning the dial yesterday felt like easy listening on the radio again after the heavy metal thunder of last week, but it isn?t necessarily static-free. volatility, even with today?s turn lower, remains well above where it was a week ago. also, bond buying came back into the picture yesterday before retreating this morning. the 10-year treasury yield ticked down to 1.07% on monday before jumping back up to 1.11% this morning. sometimes the bond market can be a good barometer of investor sentiment, and right now it does feel like things have turned around a bit since yesterday. this morning?s yield rally could potentially put financial stocks and the russell 2000 (rut) small-cap index in line for some support. now that you?ve read the fine print, it was good to see some stocks like apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) rebound after neither got any market credit for their solid earnings reports last week. there isn?t always just one reason why shares fall after a company surpasses earnings expectations, and plenty of theories got offered during the swirl of events that hit wall street the last few days. one idea, especially for aapl, is that the stock had simply built in most of the good news ahead of time and fell victim to a bit of profit taking. one thing to note as more ?faangs? report later today (see below) is that the mega-caps like aapl, its fellow faangs, and msft continue to dominate from a market capitalization standpoint, which means how they do on any given day often helps shape the overall market. technically, it was positive monday to see the spx bounce off of its 50-day moving average near 3716, but keep in mind that it wasn?t able to come back and close above the 20-day moving average, now near 3792. it looks like the market is trying to find a trading range, and the spx remains only about 2.5% below the all-time high posted last month. a close above 3792 today might suggest additional strength. ?stay at home? stocks like the faangs and semiconductors did well yesterday, but you can?t really say it was just a stay at home rally. not when you saw the rut also bounce back in a big way. consumer discretionary also had a nice day, though that?s a mix of reopening and stay at home companies. or ?drive-up? companies, shall we say, considering the way things look now at many big box stores. faang earnings wrap up today with alphabet, amazon earnings afternoons don?t come much bigger than today, when amazon (amzn) and alphabet (googl) open their books. amzn is expected to exceed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever in q4 according to amzn?s own quarterly guidance. net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $121.0 billion, or to grow between 28% and 38% compared with q4 2019, though the company noted $4 billion in covid-19 related costs are expected for q4. both holiday sales and the company?s amazon web services (aws) cloud business are likely to be the focus when amzn reports, but you might also want to monitor the company?s earnings call for the latest on other businesses like payments, fintech, or the company?s entry into the pharmacy segment. amzn has also offered to help distribute the covid-19 vaccine, but there haven?t been many details about this. the call could provide more insight. with googl, we?ll see if ad revenue continued to bounce back after a strong q3. googl?s q3 ad revenue of $37.1 billion?up 10% year over year following q2?s negative 8%?appeared to indicate a revival from the pandemic damage of q2. ad revenue for search and youtube both looked strong in q3, so the question is whether that momentum lasted into the end of the year. googl crushed wall street?s expectations last time out, so that might put some pressure on them to do that again or risk disappointing the street. word from the factory floor the manufacturing economy slowed just a little last month, but remains in pretty decent shape all things considered. when you look at a reading like yesterday?s headline number of 58.7 from the institute of supply management, it?s tempting to be disappointed because it fell from 60.5 the prior month and came in a bit below analysts? estimates. if you put it in context it gets a little easier to like. it?s still well above the 50 level that signifies expansion, and the previous month?s was the highest in three years. solid growth in ism like we?ve been seeing is often a positive sign that companies are out there spending and getting ready for heavy demand. it isn?t just in the u.s. where you see signs of manufacturing strength. recent readings out of europe and china also showed expansion, though china?s data fell slightly in january from december. analysts said the slight dip in manufacturing activity early this year might have reflected pandemic-based shutdowns in some regions. chart of the day: follow the leader. the nyse fang+ index ($nyfang:ifus?candlestick) has regained its place as a ?leading indicator? for the overall market over the last couple of years, and that?s been apparent over the last week. the faangs stumbled, and so did the broader market, demonstrated here by the s&p 500 index (spx?purple line). when faangs regained their feet yesterday, so did the spx. data sources: s&p dow jones indices, nyse. the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. right where 2020 left off: the initial public offering (ipo) mania that gathered steam late last year doesn?t show signs of cooling so far in 2021. companies have raised $13.4 billion through 24 ipos so far this year, a 300% jump in listings from the same period last year, the wall street journal reported, citing data from renaissance capital. the wsj added that ?blank-check companies? continued to flood the market, with 91 gathering about $25 billion, nearly a third of the value raised throughout all of last year, according to spacinsider.com. and there have been 111 offerings of additional shares by u.s.-listed companies, doubling the number from the same period a year earlier, dealogic data show. in other words, the market remains abuzz, so to speak, with lots of new companies and a lot of investors looking for places to put the

1542,2021-02-03 13:15:44," there?s a lot of talk about the return of ?boring? in washington, d.c. maybe it?s happening on wall street, too, and many investors would likely welcome that after the wild january we just had. robust earnings late tuesday from amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn) and alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl) turned the focus back toward earnings this morning. some of the frenzy moved to the fringes as the week continued, calming things a little. volatility edged lower again early wednesday as the short squeeze mania died down. bonds also retreated, taking the 30-year yield up to nearly 2% and the 10-year yield up to 1.12%. the improving economy and expected stimulus are starting to show up in the bond market, and strong earnings might also be part of that. earnings season usually turns the focus back toward the market?s inner workings, but that hadn?t been the case as much this time around with all these distractions. now it feels as if we?re getting back to the things that really matter?boring but essential stuff like cash flow, r&d, sg&a. all those fun things that veteran market watchers love to dissect this time of year. earnings season started out slow but keeps getting better. and now at least some companies are enjoying the fruits of their labors, so to speak, as investors reward stocks like googl for strong quarterly performance. earlier on this earnings season, it felt like meeting expectations often got companies punished, and even beating expectations didn?t bring much reward. part of this might have to do with the market being up so much already. bezos news distracts from huge quarter yesterday?s surprising announcement that amzn ceo jeff bezos plans to leave his position later this year didn?t immediately seem to move shares, though everyone?s still soaking up the news. maybe the stock didn?t react too much because he?s really not going anywhere. bezos will be executive chairman, which means he?s likely to keep himself involved in at least some of the day-to-day business. think back to when bill gates of microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) left the ceo spot to become chairman in 2000. he kept playing a big role until 2006 when he officially stepped aside. not to say it?s exactly the same situation with bezos now, but that may be what some investors are thinking. msft?s stock didn?t move much the day gates took a new position in 2006. one of the more interesting questions to ponder in coming months is what andy jassy?who?s set to take over as amzn ceo in q3 and currently heads cloud computing behemoth amazon web services (aws)?might have in mind when he grabs the wheel. he?s certainly going to bring a lot of cloud experience, and that?s been a huge focus of amzn?s business (and success) lately. getting down to nuts and bolts, amzn joined apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) in the $100 billion quarterly revenue club by easily outpacing wall street analysts? expectations on earnings and revenue in q4. it looks like holiday shopping helped the company. the question is whether amzn shares can continue their rally, because lately the tech stocks that beat on earnings got punished in the market. think back to aapl last week and msft not long before that. with those two, it felt like a classic ?buy the rumor, sell the news? scenario, though arguably aapl got caught up in some of last week?s frenzy. things were also in good shape over at googl, on a very busy tuesday afternoon. the company beat analysts? estimates on top- and bottom lines as well as in every business, quarterly ad revenue kept up its momentum from the prior quarter, and shares rocketed 7% to all-time highs in pre-market trading. so at least in googl?s case so far, positive news isn?t being treated as a reason to take shares lower. another big development tuesday was plummeting volatility, but keep in mind that contracts farther out in the cboe volatility index (vix) futures complex indicate chances for higher values in the months ahead. this could serve as a warning sign that we?re far from out of the woods as far as volatility is concerned. that?s especially relevant after we saw vix leap from 21 to 37 in just a day last week. this isn?t the sort of move that?s quickly forgotten, and it?s probably still reverberating in the market. the vix?now back below 25?tends to spend a lot of time in certain trading ranges, so the next few days could help us get a sense of where that range might be. vix had been between 20 and 25 for a while before last week?s surge. on the plus side, treasury yields rebounded nicely yesterday. the 10-year yield made it back above 1.1% at times before ending the day just below that, and the financial sector appeared to draw some strength from the yield move. financials climbed 2.5% to lead all sectors yesterday, but every sector rose. the russell 2000 (rut) index of small-caps, heavily weighted toward banks, actually had a so-so day compared to most other indices, but still leads the major indices with a nearly 9% gain year-to-date. the s&p 500 index (spx) now has 2% gains for 2021 after falling into the red for the year late last week. it?s kind of amazing what two positive days can do. it?s hard to pinpoint a single reason why stocks have done so well so far this week. growing optimism about vaccination progress, last week?s positive news on vaccine trials, the unwinding of some of last week?s short squeezes, hopes for a stimulus, some decent economic data, and improving earnings expectations (see more below) all could be playing a role. payrolls report looms: analysts expect anemic growth tuesday was pretty dead from a data perspective, but things pick up as the week continues. initial claims and factory orders highlight tomorrow?s calendar, with analysts expecting claims at 825,000, research firm briefing.com said. that would be down slightly from 847,000 the prior week, but this isn?t a statistic that?s fit into any particular pattern for a while. it bounces up and down pretty unpredictably, which is unfortunate because you?d like to see a steady downward trend. that just hasn?t happened. it?s the opposite case with friday?s monthly jobs report, where you?d like to see a steady up-trend in job creation. the trend has definitely been in the wrong direction since last fall, reaching a new low last month when job losses outnumbered gains due to nearly 500,000 lost positions in the leisure and hospitality sector. that led to a net job loss of 140,000, but remember it wasn?t all bad. there were plenty of green shoots as job gains occurred in construction, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, health care, and manufacturing. if those sectors continued to add jobs in january, it would probably make people feel better about the overall report even if leisure and hospitality again drags things down. the average analyst estimate is for total job growth of 50,000 in january, briefing.com said. that?s a pretty anemic number when you compare it to typical monthly growth of around 150,000 to 200,000 in the years before the pandemic. analysts expect hourly wages to rise about 0.3% in january, down from 0.8% in december. that uptick in december wages might have reflected the loss of leisure and hospitality jobs, an industry where pay tends to be low. also, keep an eye on the u6 unemployment rate, which accounts for unemployed and underemployed workers. it fell to 11.7% in december from 12% in november, but remains historically high. if the economy really starts improving, this number should start dropping dramatically as more people find a way back into the workforce. chart of the day: carving a range? after the s&p 500 index (spx?candlestick) dropped below its 20-day moving average (blue line) last week and briefly testing its 50-day moving average (red line) on friday, it rebounded to close tuesday above the 20-day again. this could be a sign of strong technical support at the 50-day. any closes above the 20-day ma (now right near 3800) going forward could potentially indicate more strength ahead. if that doesn?t happen, it?s possible it could bounce back and fort

1554,2021-02-03 16:53:54," the end of january is reserved for learning how tech and e-commerce companies did during the holiday season. more precisely, all faamg stock, namely alphabet inc (nasdaq: goog)(nasdaq: googl), apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb), amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn), and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft), have now shown just how much they crushed the holiday season. amazon's blockbuster quarter amazon has beaten the revenue expectations for the past consequent seven quarters, pushed by covid-19 driven e-commerce and cloud business. the previous two quarters had the most impressive realization in revenues compared to the expectations and this time around, amazon delivered its largest quarter by revenue of all time, generating $125.56 billion in sales. since the amount of us online purchases grew 32% to $188 billion during this record-breaking holiday season, no wonder amazon had its first $100 billion quarter, with revenue increasing 44% from last year's quarter. outside of its core business, the cloud-computing segment fell slightly short of wall street's expectations of $12.83 billion but did increase 28% from last year's quarter $9.95 billion to $12.7 billion. refinitiv analysts expected $7.23 earnings per share which would be a moderate increase of 11% compared to the previous year. amazon delivered $14.09 while it had higher costs than usual as it also paid a one-time $300 bonus to front line employees in november. in q1 of 2021, covid-19-related costs are expected to drop to about $2 due to lower volumes. revenue for q1 2021 is expected to be in the range between $100 billion and $106 billion, although less than the holiday blockbuster quarter, still greater 33% and 40% from a year earlier with profit in the range profit of between $3 billion and $6.5 billion. as for the whole year, sales surged 38% to $386.1 whereas profit roughly doubled to $21.3 billion compared to 2019. jack ma's friction with beijing cast a shadow over alibaba's strong results and surge in sales alibaba group holding ltd's (nyse: baba) core business, e-commerce, also benefited from the covid-19 driven trend to do more shopping online from the comfort of our own homes. also on tuesday, alibaba has beaten the expectations and reported an increase of 37% in revenues in the quarter ended in december, compared to a year earlier. however, its strong results have been overshadowed by the chinese government which is taking a more conservative approach towards entrepreneurs who own large tech businesses. jack ma, alibaba's co-founder, has been negatively affected by this approach and some analysts and experts are concerned this friction could hamper alibaba's growth as they did pull the plug on ant group's ipo two days before it was supposed to take place. these factors cloud also undermine the investor's confidence in amazon and other tech companies. the government fears that big private tech companies have too much influence and power on the financial industry and other sensitive segments. latest developments alibaba's long-term investors might see the governmental pressure as nothing else but noise as jack ma china is leading a company that is on top of china's technological capabilities and well-positioned to benefit from digitalization of consumption, along with growing spending power. as for jeff bezos, amazon's founder and the man who fundamentally changed how we buy stuff, he will be stepping down from his ceo role in the q3 of 2021 to focus more on strategy as the executive chairman of the company. this transition should be a smooth one, since bezos' right-hand andy jassy, who joined amazon in 1997 and now serves as ceo of amazon web services, will be taking the helm as the new ceo. this article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for iamnewswire. it should not be construed as investment advice at any time please read the full disclosure. iam newswire does not hold any position in the mentioned companies. press releases ? if you are looking for full press release distribution contact: press@iamnewswire.com contributors ? iam newswire accepts pitches. if you're interested in becoming an iam journalist contact: contributors@iamnewswire.com the post e-commerce titans wrapped 2020 with a bang appeared first on iam newswire. photo by rupixen.com on unsplash see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingaa preview of the busy earnings week aheadelectric vehicles are on fire? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1555,2021-02-03 16:57:26," on tuesday, google's parent alphabet inc (nasdaq: goog)(nasdaq: googl) literally crushed it with its last reported quarter. despite alphabet announcing that its cloud business remained unprofitable, google's core advertising business overperformed estimates, leading its stock price to rise 8% . what do fourth-quarter figures say? alphabet's gross revenues rose 23% to $56.9 billion, while profit rose by an astonishing 45% year-over-year, to $22.30 an adjusted share. this surpasses analyst's expectations by 6.78%, since they projected gross revenues of $52.8 billion, with earnings per share $18.59, which is almost 20% less than achieved. net revenue minus traffic acquisition costs (tac) of $46.42 billion topped the estimates by 6.22%. tac has risen 23% to $10.47 billion since google relies on apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), partner sites, and third-party applications to generate higher mobile advertising revenues. furthermore, alphabet disclosed google cloud's operating result for the first time, presenting that this part of the business made a $5.61 billion loss during 2020, and a $1.24 billion loss during q4. cloud business revenues were $3.83 billion, while analysts expected $3.8 billion. this presents a 47% year-over-year increase. despite the loss, google will continue to develop its cloud unit through disciplined investments to scale the business and improve profitability, as google and alphabet ceo sundar pichai stated. on the other hand, its rival amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn) reported its cloud business earned an operating profit of $13.53 billion in 2020. advertising business is shining brightly advertising revenue for the fourth quarter amounted to $46.20 billion, which is approximately 22% higher, comparing to the same quarter of 2019 when the company generated $37.93 billion. q4 2020 showed the best performance in the last 16 quarters for this internet titan. it implies the total recovery of the pandemic, unlike q2 when the company recorded an 8% annualized decrease in ad revenues year-over-year for the first time in history. youtube ads soared 46% comparing to q4 2019, with earnings of $4.72 billion. youtube performance is particularly strong in direct-response ads, which practically did not exist threeyears ago, said google's chief business officer philipp schindler. furthermore, youtube reaches more 18?49-year-olds than all tv networks together, with more than 100 million people streaming youtube from their tvs. perspectives for growth, therefore, remain strong and robust. can antitrust lawsuits affect its earnings? despite a successful year, there might be some trouble in paradise. due to the pandemic, more people became more dependent than ever on the internet which helped google thrive. therefore, regulators became even more concerned that google is using its search engine, mapping service, and android operating system to gain an unfair advantage. both the us department of justice and the us group of states led by texas filed an antitrust lawsuit. google said that these lawsuits were ""deeply flawed"" and this is certainly not the first time the tech giant is being grilled by regulators, but it remains to be seen whether these allegations can have a negative impact on google's overall performance. this article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for iamnewswire. it should not be construed as investment advice at any time please read the full disclosure. iam newswire does not hold any position in the mentioned companies. press releases ? if you are looking for full press release distribution contact: press@iamnewswire.com contributors ? iam newswire accepts pitches. if you're interested in becoming an iam journalist contact: contributors@iamnewswire.com the post google smashed top and bottom-line wall street estimates appeared first on iam newswire. photo by solen feyissa on unsplash see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingae-commerce titans wrapped 2020 with a banga preview of the busy earnings week ahead? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1590,2021-02-04 09:30:37," credit suisse analyzes a sector big tech is in no hurry to get into and expresses a preference for international merchant acquirers and processors, including paypal holdings inc. (nasdaq: pypl). the payments business exploits secular growth trends, starting with the ongoing trend towards detachment from cash, which has resulted in a strong digital payments growth over the last decade, according to a 2020 mckinsey report. the structural growth of the payments market is clearly visible in network companies and for processor/merchant acquirers. aside from moving money, innovations such as nfc cards for proximity use, peer-to-peer (p2p) feature and push payments support the ecosystem. an e-commerce accelerated trend: samuel traub, equity research analyst - banks/insurance at credit suisse, pointed out that the e-commerce secular trend is also growing fast, pushing digital payments activities and creating new needs. both incumbent and newcomer operators have developed capabilities in remote digital payments, with paypal leading the way in online payments. on the customer side, innovative solutions have also emerged such as digital wallets and p2p payment apps, reflecting the preference for convenience and speed, made possible by smartphone penetration. big tech hesitates to get in: the credit suisse analyst noted that big tech names like apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), facebook inc. (nasdaq: fb), alphabet inc. (nasdaq: googl) (nasdaq: goog) and amazon.com inc. (nasdaq: amzn) have been making waves the industry for some time now, taking advantage of the user base size and also aiming to create a connection among merchants in order to facilitate consumer-to-business payments. however, for the time being, big tech hesitates to enter a heavily regulated industry and prefer to partner with credit cards and banks, even though they may use their payment capabilities as a backdoor to build a banking-as-a-service (baas) platform in the future. investment names and ideas: having said that, despite generally lofty valuations, credit suisse sees attractive investment opportunities in the larger global card networks - with a preference for visa inc. (nyse: v) - but also considers digital-enabled merchant acquirers and processors with a broad range of products and international experience such as adyen (otc: adyey), paypal, fiserv inc.

(nasdaq: goog)(nasdaq: googl). these so-called faang stocks continue to deliver year-after-year of incredible growth numbers, even as their market caps swell to some of the largest in market history. while other companies were crushed by the pandemic, these faang stocks thrived in an environment of social distancing and remote working. related link: ,000, 5 years later: how much would microsoft stock be worth? tech leadership continues: investors have done extremely well overall in the past five years, but some stocks have certainly performed better than others. the s&p 500 (nyse: spy) total return in the past five years is 110.5%, but the nasdaq?s total return in that stretch is an incredible 198.9%. the nasdaq kicked off 2016 trading at around 4,900. concerns over slowing economic growth in china sent the index tumbling to as low as 4,209.76 in early 2016, its low point of the past five years. from that point, growth numbers from the faang group and the rest of the tech sector sent the nasdaq on a tear. the index broke the 6,000 mark in 2017 and 8,000 mark in 2018. at that point, the nasdaq ran out of steam. a trade war with china, federal reserve interest rate hikes and ramping regulatory scrutiny of the faang stocks sent the nasdaq tumbling back down to as low as 6,190 by the end of the year. from there the rally resumed, and the nasdaq was back making new all-time highs again by mid-2019. the index ultimately peaked at 9,838 prior to the 2020 covid-19 pandemic sell-off in march, which dropped the nasdaq all the way back down to 6,631. the sell-off was short-lived, however, and the nasdaq hit the 10,000 mark for the first time during the summer of 2020. the index ultimately peaked at 13,728 in january of 2021 before pulling back slightly to around 13,338 today. patience pays off: at this point, the faang stocks have grown into complete tech sector juggernauts. but some of them have made for better investments than others over the past five years. here?s a breakdown of how much buying $1,000 in each stock back in 2016 would be worth today, assuming reinvested dividends: facebook: $2,302 amazon: $5,462 apple: $5,854 netflix: $5,797 alphabet: $2,400 overall, a $5,000 investment in these five stocks split evenly during the past five years would be worth $21,815 today, a 336.3% gain over a five-year period. benzinga?s take: all five of the faang stocks have outpaced the 111.5% total return of the s&p 500 over the past five years. amazon, apple and netflix have also each more than doubled the overall return of the nasdaq during that stretch.

1639,2021-02-04 21:02:41," qualcomm, inc. (nasdaq: qcom) shares pulled back thursday in the wake of the company's first-quarter report. the qualcomm analysts: rosenblatt securities analyst kevin cassidy maintained a buy rating on qualcomm shares and upped the price target from $175 to $180. morgan stanley analyst joseph moore maintained an overweight rating and lowered the price target from $171 to $167. raymond james analyst chris caso reiterated a strong buy rating and $190 price target. keybanc capital markets analyst john vinh maintained an overweight rating and $180 price target. why qualcomm's 5g upgrade prospects are intact: qualcomm delivered an in-line revenue quarter, with industrywide capacity constraints limiting upside to revenue, rosenblatt analyst cassidy said in a note. earnings exceeded expectations due to a higher gross margin, which benefited from certain customers making early and unexpected deliveries of products, the analyst said. the guidance for a seasonal decline in march quarter revenue and a sharp sequential decline in margin at the qualcomm technology licensing segment should disappoint investors, he said. ""we see this as temporary and not a structural change to the company's profitability."" the guidance for a 4% sequential decline in the qualcomm cdma technologies segment revenue is well above the 15% seasonal decline, cassidy said. the upside will stem from increasing content in 5g smartphones and strong demand for adjacent automotive and iot products, the analyst said. rosenblatt said it sees no structural change to qualcomm's prospects in front of the 5g upgrade cycle. related link: qualcomm analysts hail huawei settlement as asserting company's 5g tech leadership morgan stanley sees qualcomm tailwinds: qualcomm's chipsets segment revenue guidance for the march quarter was stronger than expected, but the company signaled a drawdown in the june quarter, morgan stanley analyst moore said. view more earnings on qcom this, along with lower royalty revenues for the march and june quarters, makes the quarter a complicated one, the analyst said. operating expenses were slightly higher, and mix-related gross margin pressure is evident in chipsets, he said. all of these factors will be negative for the june quarter, moore said. royalties will reflect weaker expectations from huawei in the march quarter and beyond, the analyst said. yet the huawei shortfall has been a key driver of the chipset outperformance, as the market share that previously accrued to huawei shifts to qualcomm customers, he said. morgan stanley said it still sees the potential for qualcomm's tailwinds to resume going forward. raymond james sticks to qualcomm thesis: qualcomm delivered a mixed report in which supply constraints failed to deliver the upside the street had hoped for, raymond james analyst caso said. yet the march quarter was solidly ahead and better than seasonal, with auto/iot continuing to beat expectations, the analyst said. commentary on the june quarter, he said, implied that chipset revenue would decline by about 14% sequentially due to apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) seasonality. the china revenue opportunity ? driven by replacing huawei/hisilicon ? is now pushed to the second half of fiscal 2021 due to supply constraints, caso said. ""net, the report probably isn't good enough for today given the stock's recent run, but it also doesn't change our thesis, and our fy22 numbers remain largely unchanged."" qualcomm's 2021 looks robust, keybanc says: the company expects the supply constraints to impact first-half results and normalize in the second half, analyst vinh said in a note. according to the company, the key drivers for 2021 are an anticipated high-single-digit annual increase in total global handset shipment, a doubling of 5g smartphones in 2021 to 500 million and anticipated share gains related to other oems gaining share at the expense of huawei, the analyst said. qcom price action: at last check, qualcomm shares were retreating 8.83% to $147.97. related link: 'halftime report' final trades: qualcomm, blackstone and more photo: qualcomm. latest ratings for qcom datefirmactionfromto feb 2021morgan stanleymaintainsoverweight feb 2021rosenblattmaintainsbuy feb 2021citigroupdowngradesbuyneutral view more analyst ratings for qcom view the latest analyst ratings see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingawhy plug power is rising for fourth straight sessionnio's smart ev industrial park partnership with hefei government: what you need to know? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1667,2021-02-05 14:02:35," snap inc (nyse: snap) and pinterest inc (nyse: pins) had a very successful year. records were beaten during the pandemic-embodied 2020, with a solid perspective ahead for the upcoming period. unlike facebook, inc. (nasdaq: fb), which could potentially feel a damaging impact of apple inc's (nasdaq: aapl) upcoming privacy changes, both snap and pinterest went below the radar, with a strong performance during the fourth quarter of 2020. snap's 4q figures snap fourth-quarter results topped expectations, mostly due to an increase in internet advertising of its flagship application snapchat and due to an increase in the number of users. namely, 4q revenues were $911.3 million, exceeding $856.1 million expected by bloomberg analysts by 6.45%. the company generated $560.9 million of revenues in 4q 2019 and therefore achieved a 62% increase. adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter amounted to 9 cents vs. 7 cents expected, while the company earned 3 cents per share year-over-year. furthermore, fourth-quarter revenue growth was 62%, which presented the fastest growth rate since the company went public in 2017. it is clear that advertisers started spending more money on ads, after lying low in 2q 2020 in a covid-ravaged economy. for the first time, the company has achieved its first full-year profit on an adjusted ebitda basis. observing the number of daily active users, snap made a 22% increase to 265 million, also topping estimates. furthermore, snap's average revenue per user jumped strongly 33% to $3.44. still, it's not so shiny after all as snap expects first-quarter adjusted ebitda loss between $50 million and $70 million, while analysts expected a forecast of $17.5 million profit. on the other end, the company expects revenues between $720 million and $740 million, which is above the expected $705 million. despite the growing advertiser base, the key point in the following period will be maintaining the momentum once the pandemic restrictions are put to ease and users get to go out of their houses and away from their devices. snap shares rose 208% over the past 12 months, and 17% year-to-date. pinterest 4q figures pinterest has beaten both top and bottom-line estimates on thursday when it announced its 4q results. as a result, its stock rose 10% in after-hours trading. transformed into key figures, pinterest reached $706 million in revenues, which is 9% higher than expected. the number of monthly active users jumped to 459 million vs. 449.4 million expected. earnings per share surged to 43 cents, while 32 cents were projected, presenting a 34% upside. the average revenue per user amounted to $1.57, topping expectations by 9%. overall, 4q figures reflect a strong quarter with huge perspectives for growth. namely, pinterest's international revenues surged almost 100% in 4q 2020 compared to 2019, and the vision board platform is just getting started. the average revenue per user in the us in 3q was $3.85, while the international average revenues per user were just 21 cents. therefore, revenue-generating potential is enormous. pandemic is not the enemy as far as social media is concerned to summarize, although almost all industries will remember 2020 as the worst in the 21st century, big tech and social media giants achieved unprecedented records by becoming essential in a pandemic-shaped reality. despite facebook's failed attempts to crush these two companies, their robust 4q performance has positioned them well to continue their winning streak, especially as they are parent-friendly and controversy-free, unlike the social media gorilla which has quite a few battles to fight on those fronts. this article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for iamnewswire. it should not be construed as investment advice at any time please read the full disclosure. iam newswire does not hold any position in the mentioned companies. press releases ? if you are looking for full press release distribution contact: press@iamnewswire.com contributors ? iam newswire accepts pitches. if you're interested in becoming an iam journalist contact: contributors@iamnewswire.com the post snap and pinterest are soaring infront of facebook's nose appeared first on iam newswire. photo by thought catalog on unsplash see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingapeloton pedals to record revenue but fails to wow investorsford motor company's big transition plans? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

1781,2021-02-08 12:41:22," each day, benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that occurred on this date. what happened? on this day in 19i71, the national association of securities dealers automated quotation was launched. where was the market? the s&p 500 was at 97.45 and the dow jones industrial average stood at 882.12. what else was going on? in 1971, charles manson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, and walt disney co (nyse: dis) opened walt disney world in orlando, florida. a gallon of gas cost 40 cents. nasdaq opens its doors: the nasdaq was founded in 1971 by the national association of securities dealers. when it opened for trading in february 1971, the nasdaq was the first fully automated stock market in the world. it originated as a quotation system for stock prices but soon allowed for electronic trading as well. the nasdaq went on to become the first u.s. market to allow online trading and assumed most of the trading that was previously conducted over-the-counter. during the tech boom of the 1980s and 1990s, the nasdaq became the primary exchange for companies like microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft), cisco systems, inc. (nasdaq: csco) and amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn). the nasdaq composite started with just 50 companies in 1971. today, the nasdaq is home to more than 2,800 stocks, including the world?s most valuable company: apple inc.

"
1782,2021-02-08 12:56:22," wall street has a tough act to follow, and that?s not a reference to last night?s game. stocks rose every day last week, which is hard to pull off twice in a row. what could break the five-day winning streak? well, you?ve got a lot of things that almost feel like they?re pointing toward inflation. for instance, the 10-year yield has been galloping along, recently reaching almost 1.2%. that?s up nearly 20 basis points from late january, but still historically low. rising yields can signal improving economic conditions and hopes for more fiscal stimulus, but also might get some people nervous about inflation prospects. crude prices are also accelerating, which is nice if you?re an energy sector investor but not so great if you?re an airline still dealing with weak travel demand. now your jet fuel costs are also rising. meanwhile, you may have noticed you?re paying more at the pump. gas prices hit $3 a gallon in some places over the weekend. crude powered through $57 a barrel early monday. volatility keeps easing, with the cboe volatility index (vix) now approaching the lower end of its long-term range down near 20. this is a level the vix hasn?t been below in a year, and some analysts suspect it won?t anytime soon due to the heavy options activity still going on. this week?s earnings schedule is dominated by old stalwarts of the u.s. economy like coca-cola co (nyse: ko), general motors company (nyse: gm), and walt disney co (nyse: dis). almost 80 s&p 500 companies report over the next five days. stocks have a positive tone early on, helped in part by stimulus expectations. on another note, bitcoin rose above $43,000 this morning after tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) invested $1.5 billion. taking an early spring break? the way the market behaved friday, it almost felt like investors were putting the pandemic behind them. obviously we?re still in the thick of it, but that can?t stop people from hoping for better, apparently. look at the types of stocks that caught a tailwind late last week and it?s obvious the reopening hypothesis continues to gain strength. darden restaurants (dri) and starbucks corporation (nasdaq: sbux), wynn resorts, limited (nasdaq: wynn), mgm resorts international (nyse: mgm), southwest airlines co (nyse: luv), and hilton hotels corporation (nyse: hlt) all threw a party, putting wall street in vacation mode. meanwhile, the technology sector brought up the rear on friday despite many of us still being locked down with our laptops. generally, cyclical and small-cap stocks that tend to benefit from reopening and fiscal stimulus led the charge much of last week. the disappointing jobs report friday (see more below) might have strengthened hopes for a large stimulus package from congress, research firm briefing.com observed, maybe lending some support to cyclicals. maybe it?s a case of early spring fever, and it might not last. the market has come very far, very fast, raising concerns about valuations. on the one hand, the current rock bottom fed interest rates can make people more comfortable with higher valuations, as my fellow tda network* contributor kevin hincks pointed out friday afternoon. on the other hand, treasury yields resumed their upward climb last week after falling in late january (see more below). while some analysts think the 10-year yield would have to climb roughly another 80 basis points to really start weighing on stocks, it may not be a coincidence that large growth stocks in tech?which tend to be more rate sensitive?had some tough sledding friday. two of the biggest behemoths, apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft), didn?t participate in the rally. earnings onslaught not leaving town the biggest chunk of earnings season is behind us, and so far, about 80% of s&p 500 companies have beaten wall street?s earnings estimates, according to factset. that may sound great, but keep in mind that analysts? projections weren?t much to write home about. they?ve had to keep raising them as actual numbers came in. what might matter more than earnings is revenue. a company can do lots of stuff to make the bottom line shine, but when it comes to bad revenue, there?s no place to hide. through late last week, the revenue numbers weren?t amazing, but 75% of companies had done better than analysts projected. again, we?re dealing with low expectations during the pandemic. as barron?s pointed out, however, earnings are actually rising year over year in q4, not too shabby when you consider that q4 2020 was during the pandemic and q4 2019 wasn?t. that speaks to the amazing resilience of so many companies, but also to the way big tech and communications services firms have been able to take advantage of the ?stay at home? economy to grow faster than many had expected. so far, tech and health care are doing the best this earnings season, with energy and industrial firms trailing the pack.= keep an eye on guidance as earnings flow continues the earnings parade slows a bit this week but it?s far from over. some of the firms we?re expecting to hear from include twitter inc (nyse: twtr), ko, pepsico, inc. (nasdaq: pep), kraft heinz co (nasdaq: khc), gm, uber technoloiges inc (nyse: uber), astrazeneca plc (nasdaq: azn), and dis. as usual, investors will likely be paying just as much attention to executives? outlooks as they do to the top and bottom lines. on the data side, this week brings consumer price index data and university of michigan sentiment. in the past, a tepid jobs report like friday?s might have boosted the market by keeping concerns of a rate hike off the table. it feels like a long time since we had that kind of thinking following a jobs report, simply because the fed has promised to keep rates near zero for years to come. speaking of the fed, it?s front and center this wednesday when fed chairman jerome powell is scheduled to speak on ?the state of the u.s. labor market? as part of an economic club of new york webinar. that presentation will be broadcast live. chart of the day: halfway back. the 10-year treasury yield (tnx?candlestick) resumed climbing last week after a short break, and is now about halfway back to where it was pre-covid a year ago, as this one-year chart shows. during that same time period, the s&p 500 index (spx?purple line) has surpassed the early 2020 highs, but rising yields could pose a threat to more gains. data sources: cboe, s&p dow jones indices. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. rising costs: despite friday?s soft employment data, bonds continued to decline as the old week ended. the 30-year bond yield came within striking distance of 2% by early monday at 1.99%. if nothing else, this may get people a little concerned about possible rising mortgage rates, which would be a double-whammy for home buyers already facing the highest prices ever. the last time the 30-year yield topped 2% was nearly a year ago, last feb. 19. even that pre-pandemic yield was down sharply from a peak of 3.46% in november 2018. if there is inflation concern in the market, it could come from the commodities. crude has done nothing but climb so far this year, and the metals complex is also starting to shine (aside from gold). copper?an important industrial metal used in all sorts of products?is trading at levels last seen in 2012. you can?t necessarily rule out commodity inflation spoiling the party stocks are throwing. buying ink by the barrel: the new york times co (nyse: nyt) reported earnings last week and shared a pretty amazing statistic: subscribership keeps rising and recently hit 7.5 million. the paper?s management has a goal of 10 million subscribers by 2025. go back about 20 years and you would have found lots of armchair experts telling you newspapers were a dead business due to the rise of the internet. in a way, they had a point. thousands of small local newspapers have gone out of business, and that?s a shame. at the same time, big guys like nyt and the wall street

1995,2021-02-09 12:34:56," what if we told you walt disney co (nyse: dis) would shutter parks and dock cruise ships during a big chunk of the busy season, do a phased reopening with limited capacity that could last well beyond a year, start a global battle with netflix inc (nasdaq: nflx) and the stock would essentially double over the period? you might think we?re talking fairy tales. but there?s no fable here. since the onset of the pandemic nearly a year ago when dis stock hit a 52-week low of $79.07 in march, shares have more than doubled, closing out last week nearly 130% higher. on a year-over-year basis, the stock is up nearly 30% compared with about 17% for the s&p 500 index (spx). those are facts. see also: how to buy disney stock what?s more, adjusted earnings for dis in the fiscal year that ended oct. 3 collapsed by 64%, the company reported. and that came after a 94% earnings pullback in its fiscal q3. and when the world?s largest entertainment conglomerate unwraps its q1 earnings thursday, wall street is widely expecting another deep double-digit dive compared with year-ago results. what?s going on in the magic kingdom? not much. remember, the theme parks and cruise ships went dark during last spring?s lockdowns, and have slowly begun reopening the gates at limited capacity since then. when dis shutters a park, it loses not only the gate revenue but also those hotel, dining, and shopping dollars as well. don?t forget, too, like every other major hollywood studio, dis, which produces movies out of pixar, marvel and walt disney studios, had to halt film releases in theaters and carefully orchestrate movie-making in the age of covid. it laid off 32,000 workers last year, saw ad revenues from espn dribble away and has struggled with its retail operations. dis? share price story (see chart below) seems to rest with wall street?s anticipation that once the world harnesses the coronavirus and its variants, and vaccinations become more widespread, everything will be all-systems-go at the house of mouse as pent-up demand is unleashed. oh, and there?s disney+ to consider, analysts said. since a marathon investor day in december, analysts have largely been upping expectations based on dis executives? guidance and the onslaught of movies they expect to be released soon. they also widely believe dis?s future is as much in direct-to-consumer (dtc) experiences as it is in theme parks and movies. figure 1: beyond the park closures. like much of the market?including the communication services sector ($ixc - purple line)?sentiment turned positive on walt disney (dis - candlestick) after the initial covid-19 scare in march 2020. data sources: nyse, s&p dow jones indices. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. the battle with netflix disney+ might underscore how quickly a dtc streaming business can grow?if circumstances (like sequestered families and limited entertainment alternatives) present themselves. with only one birthday under its belt, disney+ was reaching 86.8 million subscribers as of dec. 2, the company reported at its investor day. that was up nearly 20% from the 73 million subscriber base as of the end of q4. analysts said they?ll be listening for fresh numbers, and comparing the trajectory to internal forecasts that see the base tripling by 2024?to a jaw-dropping level of between 230 million and 260 million subscribers. dis executives have also said they plan to up the price a buck to $7.99 per month. though nflx is the king of streaming services that dis hopes to dethrone, there are plenty vying for a place in the palace: dis? hulu and espn+, apple inc?s (nasdaq: aapl) apple+, amazon.com, inc. (nasdaq: amzn) prime video, peacock, part of the comcast corporation (nasdaq: cmcsa) family and at&t inc.?s (nyse: t) hbo max. disney earnings and options activity when dis reports earnings after the close thursday, feb 11, consensus from third-party analysts expect the company to report a loss of $0.42 per share?versus a profit of $1.52 per share in the year-ago quarter?on revenue of $15.91 billion. that revenue figure would mark a fall of 23.7% from a year ago. the options market has priced in an expected share price move of 5.1% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the market maker move? indicator on the thinkorswim? platform. view more earnings on dis looking at the feb 12 options expiration, put activity has been highest at the 175 strike, but calls have seen more activity overall, with concentrations at the 190 and 200 strikes. note: call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. dis? dtc impact with hulu and espn+, the dtc segment?which includes its international subscriber count?accounted for some 26% of total revenue last year, marking an 81% jump on a year-over-year basis. analysts said they expect double-digit results again as its deals with aapl, alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl), roku inc (nasdaq: roku) and others continue to grow. add in those subscriber numbers and dis has claims on 137 million subscriptions. ?the tremendous success we?ve achieved across our unique portfolio of streaming services, with more than 137 million subscriptions worldwide, has bolstered our confidence in our acceleration toward a dtc-first business model,? dis ceo bob chapek said at the investor day. ?with our amazing creative teams and our ever-growing collection of the high-quality branded entertainment that consumers want, we believe we are incredibly well positioned to achieve our long-term goals,? he added. how many movies? investor day seemed like a bombshell for analysts based on some of their reports afterward. the company unveiled a bounty of announcements, including its plan to release more than 100 movies and shows tied to its successful franchises such as star wars, indiana jones, marvel, national geographic, and fx. among the new shows on the docket are loki, additional seasons of the mandalorian, and raya and the last dragon, and newbies such as ?jungle cruise,? an adventure film based on dis? theme park of the same name. dis is also bringing out a general entertainment content leg it?s calling star, which will be placed on disney+ with a star banner in europe, canada, australia, new zealand, and singapore, the company said. those announcements helped lead to a number of upbeat analyst calls. ?our call has been dead wrong,? lightshed partners analyst richard greenfield wrote about a month after the investor day. he noted his team ?focused on how the market under-appreciated the impact of covid-19? on fiscal 2020?2021 earnings. ?we were simply blown away (on investor day) by the depth of content being created for disney+ (and the financial oomph behind it). ?increasing content spend on disney+ to over $8 billion by 2024 compared to a target of $4 billion set just a year ago is a dramatic acceleration,? he said. no kidding. what?s ahead buoyed by the push into streaming, analysts said they also want to hear updates on when dis thinks it may be back to full steam in the theme park and cruise ship businesses based on current global realities, and how the company might be tweaking the businesses to meet a higher bar of personal comfort. theme parks are built to pack people in with crowded shows, ride queues, and resort pools. these are all logistical challenges in a socially-distant world. dis? retail business might also be ripe for a few tweaks, as revenues from movie paraphernalia and other cross-platform marketing have fallen short and may struggle to return to the way they once were. so while the place for fun and frolic deals with the impact of covid-19 closings and consumer hesitancy toward anything geared for crowds, dis is leaning into streaming like never before. ?we are prioritizing our dtc platfo

1996,2021-02-09 12:54:51," shares of apple (nasdaq:aapl) saw some unusual options activity on tuesday. following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $136.91. sentiment: neutral option type: sweep trade type: call expiration date: 2021-02-12 strike price: $138.00 volume: 1404 open interest: 17723 three signs of unusual options activity exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. the volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. these contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. bullish and bearish sentiments options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. an observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. for the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. trading options with these strategies unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account. for more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alerts see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzinga10 information technology stocks with unusual options alerts in today's session10 information technology stocks showing unusual options activity in today's session? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

2001,2021-02-09 13:10:38," will today be lucky seven? the s&p 500 index (spx) and the dow jones industrial average ($dji) start off tuesday defending six-session winning streaks, the best stretch in six months for either. the small-cap russell 2000 (rut) also hit new all-time highs yesterday. wall street is batting a thousand this february, to borrow a baseball term that represents perfection. the rut is way ahead of everyone else, up 16% so far this year as investors appear focused on smaller, more domestically-oriented stocks and banks that are well represented in the index and tend to benefit from economic stimulus. see also: how to buy twitter (twtr) stock the last time the spx started off a month as well as this was last august when it had six straight gains before faltering on day seven. today is the seventh trading session of february, so we?ll see if the index can muster a little more power to surpass august?s mark. the day begins with major indices trending lower, so it might take a new positive catalyst to turn things around. over the last few years, six days is about as long a winning streak as we?ve seen, so it wouldn?t be surprising if a bit of profit taking came into the market today. that kind of action?if it does happen?potentially could be a factor going into the long weekend, with markets shut monday for presidents day. it was interesting to see bonds gain strength yesterday and again this morning, implying maybe a bit of a risk-off move. tech, social media, and the mouse: earnings shape weekly story earnings began the week without too many fireworks. that changes today as cisco systems, inc. (nasdaq: csco) and twitter inc (nyse: twtr) prepare to report after the close. csco is a stock that doesn?t get a lot of attention day-to-day but can be a kind of beacon for the tech sector because it has its hands in so many different markets and products. this is a company many people watch because it can tell us so much about the economy and business spending trends, especially now as things reopen. twtr?s call could be interesting for more insight into its recent bans, along with user trends. looking ahead to later this week, some of the big names include uber technologies inc (nyse: uber), coca-cola co (nyse: ko) and general motors company (nyse: gm), tomorrow and walt disney co (nyse: dis) on thursday. analysts say they?ll be looking for updated numbers on the disney+ streaming service, as well as the latest on when dis thinks it may be back to full steam in the theme park and cruise ship businesses based on current global realities. the stock has been on a roll, helped by the company?s investor day back in december that appeared to wow much of wall street. we?ve been in an ?earnings recession,? defined by corporate profits posting year-over-year declines for two quarters in a row. that seems to be ending with q4 earnings, marketwatch reported. it notes that s&p 500 companies are now projected to show positive earnings growth of 1.7% for q4, with 58% of results already in. there?s still a ways to go, but the numbers point in the right direction, helped by firm results from the financial and tech sectors, according to factset research. in the long run, earnings drive the market, so that helps explain what this rally is in response to. there?s data ahead, too, with the consumer price index (cpi) for january out tomorrow morning. in december, the overall cpi rose 0.4% while the ?core? cpi that strips out food and energy rose 0.1%. analysts expect another 0.4% rise in january overall and 0.2% for the core, briefing.com said. those kinds of numbers probably wouldn?t ring too many inflation alarm bells, but with treasury yields generally rising and energy costs gaining steam, any higher than expected cpi data could draw a raised eyebrow or two. the new week began like a repeat of the previous one. cyclical sectors like energy and financials, along with small-caps, kept gaining ground while mega-caps and faangs stepped back. the tech sector wasn?t a complete washout, however. the philadelphia semiconductor index (sox) gained more than 3%. stimulus hopes and a decent earnings season appear to be driving cyclicals higher. it?s good to see more companies sharing guidance, although many are still reluctant to guide for the full year. in general, it doesn?t look like most companies expect earnings to fall apart this year, and it also might have been a boost to sentiment when exxon mobil corporation (nyse: xom) decided not to cut its dividend despite all the pain suffered by the energy sector over the last year. tracking retail investors in january retail investors came out of the gate swinging, so to speak, in january. td ameritrade?s investor movement index? (imxsm) increased to 6.91 in january, up about 10.4% from its december score of 6.26. the imx is td ameritrade?s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating main street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets. january was a month dominated by major news stories, from government stimulus to a change of power in d.c. to the start of earnings season. then it finished with some unparalleled volatility in stocks such as gamestop corp. (nyse: gme) and amc theatres holdings inc (nyse: amc). it also arguably marked the first month in almost a year where covid wasn?t the primary day-to-day story. investors tracked by the imx had 10% more exposure to the market in january than in the previous month, the biggest leap in a long time. as you would suspect, tda clients traded good amounts of gme and amc, but a bit more amc, perhaps because of the lower price point. because these two stocks only traded heavily in the last week of the month, they didn?t have as big an effect on overall january activity. the top-three ?net buys? tracked by the imx in january were apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), at&t inc. (nyse: t), and advanced micro devices, inc. (nasdaq: amd), while moderna inc (nasdaq: mrna), pfizer inc. (nyse: pfe) and intel corporation (nasdaq: intc) led the ?net-sell? list. why would vaccine makers pfe and mrna be on the wrong side of the ledger, shall we say? the reason might be that although the great news on vaccines was a huge step for fighting the pandemic, at the end of the day some investors might have been looking for what kind of catalyst could take them to the next step as their stocks leveled out a bit. chart of the day: david beating goliath. over the last three months, the nasdaq 100 (ndx?purple line) had a nice run, rising about 16%. but the ndx, which includes many of the so-called ?mega-cap? stocks, is way behind the small-cap russell 2000 (rut?candlestick) since early november. the rut is up around 34% during that stretch as investors pile into smaller companies perhaps best situated to benefit from economic stimulus and reopening. data sources: nasdaq, ftse russell. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. yield watch: after hitting 2% for the first time in about a year, 30-year bond yields walked back a bit late monday. the 10-year yield also retreated after touching a new one-year high of 1.2%. neither of these numbers is really in thin air (the all-time low 10-year yield before last year was around 1.4%), but the yield rally that?s gaining steam amid talk of a stimulus should probably be in the back of your mind as an investor. right now, close to 70% of stocks pay a dividend that?s higher than the 10-year treasury. that percentage is very close to a record high. however, if rates rise to 1.75%, that proportion drops to 44%, bank of america strategist savita subramanian said in an interview with barron?s. many investors are retirees looking for income. it?s not a given that yields can rise back to 1.75% this year (some analysts look for 1.4% to 1.5%), but it?s hard not to argue that as yields rise, fixed income could start looking more attractive than stocks to some investors. the big growth stocks, biotechs, an

2016,2021-02-09 18:48:57," a super bowl played during the covid-19 pandemic was difficult to predict ratings with people not throwing as many parties or going to bars. what happened: super bowl lv featuring the tampa bay buccaneers and kansas city chiefs had an average of 96.4 million viewers on television and streaming platforms, according to nielsen. the viewership hit a 13-year low, down 9% from last year?s super bowl average of 102 million viewers. ten of the last 11 super bowls had viewership of over 100 million. the previous low from the last ten years was 98.2 million in 2019. the good news in the ratings figures were the streaming viewership, which hit a record. super bowl lv was the most live-streamed nfl contest ever with 5.7 million viewers on average, according to axios. streaming viewership was up 65% from last year?s super bowl. related link: 5 things you might not know about tom brady why it?s important: the results are an estimate of the average viewership during super bowl lv. this year?s game may have been tough to provide data for with restaurants and bars not airing the game and it being harder to track how many people were watching in each household. the game resulted in a blowout with the buccaneers winning 31-9 and viewership typically fades if the game isn't close. a close game can result in more viewers tuning in late in the second half if they weren?t watching previously. the super bowl shows that when it comes to ratings, a competitive game matters more than any other factor. this game was the second biggest super bowl blowout in the last 18 years, per the cbs release. ? john ourand (@ourand_sbj) february 9, 2021 streaming data from sportico?s eben novy-williams shows that the streaming figures could help several companies that had a strong share of the game. roku inc (nasdaq: roku) and amazon.com (nasdaq: amzn) led the way with 41% and 24% share, respectively, of streaming viewership. apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) had a 12% share for streaming with its appletv. samsung ranked fourth with a share of 8%. video game services from sony corp (nyse: sne) and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) each had 4% market share. impact on cbs: the 91.6 million viewers could be a disappointment for viacomcbs inc (nasdaq: viac), but the company will still see a windfall of revenue from the low viewed super bowl. thirty-second commercials commanded a record $5.5 million for the big game. viacomcbs was also able to promote its upcoming streaming service paramount+ during the big game, which could lead to strong initial reception and brand awareness. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingacould super bowl lv have more viewers due to pandemic, and could it boost viacomcbs?? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

(otc: hymtf) seemed like a done deal. the south korean company - after the first successful approaches last january - was ready to make the kia plant in west point (georgia) available to apple, but some days ago the process came to a screeching halt, apparently due to internal disagreements within the hyundai board. see also: how to buy apple stock speculations on renault: however, apple has plenty of options. with the hyundai-kia hypothesis fading out, a possible partnership with renault adr (otc: rnlsy) seems to be gaining ground, with the french automaker being an ally of other major asian car manufacturers such as nissan motor co. ltd. (otc: nsany) and mitsubishi. apple's goal would be to strike an agreement with an asian company, probably to intercept the (potential) endless electric car market in the continent. renault stock on the rise: after rumors of a possible deal with renault - the automaker which manufactures zoe, one of the best-selling electric cars in the world - the french automaker's shares spiked yesterday, rising again above $40, which renault hadn?t reached since december 2019. however, shared dropped 2% today, perhaps due to a lack of confirmation or just for some profit-taking. see also: why apple could emerge as tesla's 'first true competitor' time until 2024: ""we are receiving several requests for cooperation in the joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies, but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided,"" hyundai executives said in a note in which they dismissed the deal with apple. in conclusion, the apple car will have to wait for now: there is time until 2024, which is the expected release date. this article originally appeared on financialounge.com and was translated from italian to english. it does not represent the opinion of benzinga and has not been edited. for news coverage in italian or spanish, check out benzinga italia and benzinga espa?a. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingaboom in digital payments: here are the stocks to bet on? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved.

2060,2021-02-10 12:55:21," we?re almost a month into earnings season and the hits just keep on coming. lyft inc (nasdaq: lyft), twitter inc (nyse: twtr), coca-cola co (nyse: ko), under armour inc (nyse: uaa), and yelp inc (nyse: yelp) all joined the fun last night and this morning, giving the market an early boost after yesterday?s retreat. these companies generally topped analysts? estimates and, maybe more importantly, shared positive views about their businesses and the economy. phrases like ?confidence in returning to growth? and ?encouraging signs of strength? are good to see in the press releases of reporting companies at times like these. that doesn?t mean all the news was good, and keep in mind some of the earnings achievements came through cost-cutting, not growing the business. also, cisco systems, inc. (nasdaq: csco) struggled in pre-market trading today despite topping estimates. in this case, it?s a bit like apple inc (nasdaq: aapl) and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) earlier this quarter, with investors punishing the stock because they apparently expected even better. never mind. the results looked strong and so did the company?s outlook. we?re not done yet. uber technologies inc (nyse: uber) and mgm resorts international (nyse: mgm) later today could give us an inside view at how the economy is emerging from covid-19. mgm shares have been on a roll lately, maybe on hopes of things returning to normal and more people booking vacations. in a sign that maybe some of the risk-on sentiment remains, treasury yields popped back up this morning after a two-day retreat. the question is whether the 10-year yield can claw above 1.2% and stay there, something that it hasn?t achieved in this rally. powell time this afternoon fed chairman jerome powell takes the mic at 2 p.m. et today when he makes a speech called, ?state of the u.s. labor market.? it?s part of a webinar put on by the economic club of new york. while the topic means it?s unlikely powell will discuss interest rates, maybe he?ll provide more detail on some of the remarks he made at the january fed meeting. that?s when he said the ?pace of the labor market has slowed in recent months.? it could be a chance to hear him talk more about why that?s the case and how quickly he thinks the situation could reverse. obviously, a lot of that is beyond the fed?s control?mainly because the virus, its variants, and the pace of vaccinations keep making the calls. what could be interesting is if he talks about the developing fiscal stimulus plan and its possible effects on labor. it?s unclear if he?ll take questions, but if there is a q&a it?s possible someone might ask him about the democrats? proposal to raise the minimum wage and what impact he thinks that might have. no guarantee there, of course. win streak fizzles out there?s no rule saying the market has to be exciting every day. which is good, because yesterday was one of those forgettable sessions where things just didn?t happen. it felt like some consolidation took place ahead of today?s inflation data and powell?s speech. at the same time, profit-taking pressure hasn?t shown up in a big way, which might reflect people being reluctant to exit too many long positions amid all the optimism around stimulus, vaccination, and improved earnings. that old saying, ?don?t fight the fed? could also be playing a role. still, the six-day win streak for the s&p 500 index (spx) didn?t extend to a lucky seven on tuesday, which may disappoint people who watch stuff like that. there may be a little fatigue developing at these high levels, and there haven?t been a lot of exciting new catalysts this week to entice more buyers. that being said, the market has been pricing in the reopening optimism, and in the short term that may be able to keep us grinding higher. what?s a bit worrisome is whether the reality of the economy can live up to the expectations. the expectations are just so high that you wonder when we get there, what?s next. that could be the feeling that led to some retreat yesterday in reopening stocks, including a bunch of the airlines, cruise lines, and casinos that had been helping things rally. the airline rally appears to be based on hopes for summer travel to pick up, because there?s not much travel at the moment. the transportation safety administration (tsa) daily u.s. checkpoint data shows average airport passenger flow is still well under half of where it was a year ago before the pandemic. that holiday surge just didn?t last. taking a lyft ahead of uber earnings it?s actually hard to find wider patterns so far this week, which means individual earnings may provide more insight than following the indices. overall, q4 earnings generally keep getting better (see more below). lyft got the ride-sharing segment off to a nice start yesterday, even though it still posted a big net loss for 2020. average revenue per rider hit a record high, and the company reiterated that it expects to have a profitable quarter on an adjusted basis by the end of this year. shares rose double-digits in the pre-market hours. later today the focus turns to uber, which has been able to make a little hay during the pandemic with its food delivery business. no surprise there, really, with so many people ordering in. inflation data, and a look ahead until this morning, there hadn?t been much data this week. that changed with the january consumer price index (cpi) being released. not much drama there, with a 0.3% rise right in line with expectations and down just a bit from 0.4% in december. core cpi actually came in flat, compared with analysts? average estimate for 0.2%. if powell talks about inflation in his speech today, this report doesn?t provide much hope of getting back to the fed?s 2% target anytime soon. the rest of the week has plenty of earnings action but not much data. one worry is that stock prices may be getting a bit ahead of the economy. recent data have been all over the map, but don?t all point upward. for every positive report (ism manufacturing) there seems to be another data point you can say was negative (january employment). chart of the day: sector renewal. the financial (ixm?candlestick) and energy (ixe?purple line) sectors had underperformed the broader market for months before catching some bids starting back in november, as this three-month chart shows. analysts say both sectors have continued to see positive asset flow recently, though tuesday was a tough day for energy. data source: s&p dow jones indices. chart source: the thinkorswim? platform from td ameritrade. for illustrative purposes only. past performance does not guarantee future results. disney vs. other streamers: tomorrow afternoon brings fiscal q1 earnings from disney (dis), and the disney+ streaming business is squarely in the spotlight. with only one birthday under its belt, disney+ was reaching 86.8 million subscribers as of dec. 2, the company reported at its investor day. that was up nearly 20% from the 73 million subscriber base as of the end of its fiscal q4. analysts will likely be listening tomorrow or fresh numbers, and comparing the trajectory to internal forecasts that see the base tripling by 2024?to a jaw-dropping level of between 230 million and 260 million subscribers. dis executives have also said they plan to up the price a buck to $7.99 per month. though netflix inc (nasdaq: nflx) is arguably the king of streaming services that dis hopes to dethrone, there are plenty vying for a place in the palace: dis? hulu and espn+, apple inc?s (nasdaq: aapl) apple+, amazon.com, inc.
